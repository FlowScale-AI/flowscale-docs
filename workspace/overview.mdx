  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node Library">
    **Searchable catalog** of available nodes:
    - Categorized by function (models, samplers, etc.)
    - Search and filter capabilities
    - Favorites and recently used
    - Custom node installation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Properties Panel">
    **Configure selected nodes**:
    - Parameter adjustment with validation
    - Real-time preview of changes
    - Help text and documentation
    - Batch parameter editing
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Execution Panel">
    **Monitor workflow execution**:
    - Real-time progress tracking
    - Resource usage monitoring
    - Error reporting and debugging
    - Execution history and logs
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Navigation and Controls

</Frame>

**Top Action Bar**:
- **Run**: Execute the current workflow
- **Save**: Commit changes to version control
- **Share**: Generate collaboration links
- **Deploy**: Convert workflow to API
- **Settings**: Configure workspace preferences

**Keyboard Shortcuts**:
- `Ctrl/Cmd + S`: Save workflow
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Z`: Undo action
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Y`: Redo action
- `Space`: Pan canvas (drag)
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Mouse Wheel`: Zoom in/out

## Getting Started

### Your First Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Workspace">
    Navigate to your project and click "New Workflow" or open an existing one
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Nodes">
    Drag nodes from the library to the canvas or use the right-click context menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Nodes">
    Click and drag from output sockets to input sockets to create connections
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Parameters">
    Select nodes and adjust their parameters in the properties panel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Execution">
    Click "Run" to execute your workflow and see the results
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Workflow Patterns

**Basic Text-to-Image**:
1. Checkpoint Loader → Load your AI model
2. CLIP Text Encode → Process your prompt
3. KSampler → Generate the image
4. VAE Decode → Convert to viewable format
5. Save Image → Output the result

**Image-to-Image**:
1. Load Image → Import source image
2. VAE Encode → Convert to latent space
3. KSampler → Apply transformations
4. VAE Decode → Convert back to image
5. Save Image → Export result

## Workspace Customization

### Layout Options

Customize the workspace to match your preferences:

- **Panel arrangement**: Dock panels where you need them
- **Theme selection**: Choose between light and dark themes
- **Grid settings**: Adjust grid size and visibility
- **Zoom preferences**: Set default zoom levels and animation

### Performance Settings

Optimize the workspace for your hardware:

- **Preview quality**: Balance between quality and performance
- **Automatic execution**: Enable/disable auto-run on changes
- **Resource monitoring**: Show/hide performance metrics
- **Cache settings**: Configure model and result caching

## Best Practices

### Workflow Organization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Logical Layout">
    - Arrange nodes from left to right (input → processing → output)
    - Group related functionality together
    - Use consistent spacing and alignment
    - Minimize crossing connections for clarity
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Naming Conventions">
    - Use descriptive names for complex workflows
    - Add comments to explain non-obvious logic
    - Tag workflows with relevant keywords
    - Maintain consistent naming across projects
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Documentation">
    - Add workflow descriptions and usage instructions
    - Document parameter ranges and expected inputs
    - Include example use cases and results
    - Keep change logs for major modifications
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Performance Optimization

- **Start simple**: Begin with basic workflows and add complexity gradually
- **Test incrementally**: Validate each section before building further
- **Monitor resources**: Keep an eye on GPU and memory usage
- **Use appropriate models**: Match model complexity to your needs

### Collaboration Etiquette

- **Communicate changes**: Use comments to explain modifications
- **Test before saving**: Ensure workflows run successfully before committing
- **Resolve conflicts**: Address merge conflicts promptly and clearly
- **Respect work in progress**: Coordinate with teammates on active workflows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Warning>
**Workflow won't execute**: Check that all required inputs are connected and models are loaded
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Performance is slow**: Consider using a more powerful GPU or optimizing your workflow
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Can't find a node**: Use the search function or check if custom nodes need to be installed
</Warning>

### Getting Help

- **In-editor help**: Hover over nodes and parameters for tooltips
- **Documentation**: Access comprehensive guides from the help menu
- **Community**: Join our Discord for peer support and tips
- **Support**: Contact technical support for complex issues
