<Accordion title="Missing Models Error">
**Solution**: Follow the model management workflow. Check error messages for specific model names and paths. Look for required models in the dropdown menus of the workflow nodes themselves. If models are available in the public library, they will appear in the relevant node dropdowns within your workflow.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model Not Found in Dropdown">
**Solution**: First check the Public Models library through the workflow node dropdowns. If not found, navigate to Private Models section and upload the required model. After upload completes, refresh ComfyUI from the actions bar.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Wrong Model Folder Structure">
**Solution**: Ensure you're following ComfyUI conventions for folder structure:
- Checkpoints: `models/checkpoints/`
- LoRAs: `models/loras/`
- VAE: `models/vae/`

For custom nodes, always refer to the node's GitHub repository for specific folder requirements.
