<Accordion title="Workflow Not Configured for Deployment (Red Cross Mark)">
**Issue**: Workflow shows a red cross mark in the sidebar, indicating it's not configured for deployment.

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Project sidebar showing workflow list with red cross marks next to unconfigured workflows]**

**Solution**: 
- Add FlowScale I/O nodes to your workflow (InputText, InputImage, SaveImage, etc. with "[FS]" prefix)
- Ensure at least one input and one output node are connected
- Save the workflow after adding the nodes

<Accordion title="Workflow Won't Run in ComfyUI Editor">
**Issue**: Cannot deploy a workflow that hasn't been successfully executed at least once.

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: ComfyUI editor showing a workflow with error indicators or failed execution status]**

**Solution**:
- Run the workflow completely in the ComfyUI editor first
- Verify all models and custom nodes are properly loaded
- Check for any error messages in the console
- Save the workflow after successful execution

<Accordion title="FlowScale I/O Nodes Not Appearing">
**Issue**: Cannot find FlowScale-specific nodes when searching in ComfyUI.

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: ComfyUI node search dialog showing empty results when searching for FlowScale nodes]**

**Solution**:
- Ensure you're searching for nodes with "[FS]" prefix
- Double-click on empty space in ComfyUI editor to open node search
- Try searching for: "InputText", "InputImage", "SaveImage", "SaveText"
- Restart ComfyUI if nodes are still missing

<Accordion title="Deployment Fails During Pod Selection">
**Issue**: Deployment process stops when selecting a pod.

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Deployment modal showing pod selection with error message or loading state that gets stuck]**

**Solution**:

<Accordion title="API Not Responding After Deployment">
**Issue**: Deployed API returns errors or timeouts.

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: API Server page showing deployment with error status or failed requests in the logs/monitoring section]**

**Solution**:
- Check deployment logs in the API Server page
- Verify all workflow inputs are properly configured
- Ensure the workflow runs successfully with the same inputs in the editor
- Check if GPU resources are sufficient for your workflow

<Accordion title="Playground UI Not Loading">
**Issue**: Deployed playground interface doesn't load or shows errors.

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Browser showing playground URL with loading error, blank page, or error message instead of the expected playground interface]**

**Solution**:
- Verify the workflow has proper input/output configuration
- Check that all required models are available on the deployment pod
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

<Accordion title="Configuration Lost After Saving">
**Issue**: I/O configuration disappears after saving the workflow.

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: ComfyUI editor showing a workflow where FlowScale I/O nodes appear disconnected or isolated from the main workflow graph]**

**Solution**:
- Ensure FlowScale I/O nodes are properly connected to the workflow
- Verify nodes are not isolated (must be part of the workflow graph)
- Save the workflow only after adding and connecting all I/O nodes
- Check that you're using official FlowScale I/O nodes (with "[FS]" prefix)

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: ComfyUI editor showing properly connected FlowScale I/O nodes integrated into the workflow graph with visible connections]**
