## **Key Features**

### 1. **No-code/Low-code Workflow Builder**
FlowScale AI allows users to design and execute AI workflows without writing any code. The intuitive **ComfyUI** interface lets you visually connect different components (nodes) to build powerful AI models.

- **Drag-and-drop node editor**: Build workflows by connecting pre-built components.
- **Custom nodes**: Extend your workflows with custom nodes that suit your specific AI needs.
- **Workflow versioning**: Save and track different versions of your workflows, allowing for easy collaboration and experimentation.

### 2. **Cloud GPU Infrastructure**
FlowScale AI takes the hassle out of infrastructure management by providing access to powerful cloud GPUs, including **T4, L4, A100, and H100 GPUs**, allowing users to scale their workflows efficiently.

- **Choose from multiple GPU types** based on your performance needs.
- **Seamless scaling**: Run large AI models and workflows without worrying about hardware limitations.
- **GPU management**: Monitor GPU usage and optimize workflows for faster execution.

### 3. **Collaborative Environment**
FlowScale AI is designed for teams to collaborate on building AI workflows. Multiple users can work on the same project, with built-in **version control** and **role-based access**.

- **Project-based collaboration**: Add team members to projects with specific permissions (owners, collaborators).
- **GitHub integration**: Each FlowScale AI project is backed by a **GitHub repository**, ensuring all workflows and custom nodes are securely versioned and accessible.

### 4. **API and Gradio UI Deployments**
FlowScale AI simplifies the deployment of AI workflows into scalable APIs and shareable UIs.

- **Deploy as APIs**: Transform AI workflows into APIs with one click, complete with **auto-generated API documentation (Swagger)**.
- **Gradio UIs**: Deploy workflows as **interactive AI applications** that can be shared via public URLs, enabling users to access your AI models with ease.
- **Scalability**: Built-in scalability features ensure that your APIs can handle increasing traffic seamlessly.

### 5. **Advanced Workflow Management**
With FlowScale AI, you have complete control over your workflows:

- **I/O Configuration**: Configure input/output nodes for seamless API and UI integration.
- **Model and node management**: Manage AI models and custom nodes across projects and workflow versions.
- **Monitor deployments**: Track the performance and usage of deployed workflows through logs and other monitoring tools.

## **How Does FlowScale AI Work?**

FlowScale AI is built to streamline every aspect of AI workflow management and deployment. Here's a brief overview of how the platform works:

1. **Create a Project**: Start by creating a project where your workflows, models, and nodes will be stored. Each project is backed by a GitHub repository, ensuring version control and collaboration.
2. **Build or Import a Workflow**: Use the drag-and-drop interface of ComfyUI to build a workflow, or import an existing one. You can configure custom nodes, models, and inputs/outputs.
3. **Configure Inputs and Outputs**: Before deployment, define the inputs and outputs of your workflow. This configuration allows for seamless API and UI creation.
4. **Deploy as an API or Gradio UI**: With just a few clicks, deploy your workflow as a **scalable API** or a **shareable Gradio UI**. FlowScale automatically generates API documentation and provides links for Gradio UIs.
5. **Monitor and Scale**: After deployment, use FlowScaleâ€™s monitoring tools to track usage and optimize performance. Ensure your workflow scales based on user demand.

## Workflows
When you open a Project, in FlowScale AI, you will find yourself in a view like below. This is the Editor Tab.

<Frame caption="Editor Tab">
  <img
    className="block rounded-lg"
    src="/images/introduction/editor.png"
    alt="Editor"
  />
</Frame>

Workflows are the core building blocks of FlowScale AI. A workflow in FlowScale AI is nothing but a json file that you get when you save a workflow on ComfyUI. */}
