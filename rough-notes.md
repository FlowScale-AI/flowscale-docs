### Next Steps:
Answer the above questions for each section in as much detail as possible. Once you provide these rough notes, I’ll draft detailed, user-friendly documentation for each of these critical onboarding topics.

This approach will ensure that users are fully equipped to understand the platform’s capabilities, build workflows, and deploy them efficiently. Let me know if you'd like to adjust any of these questions or if you want to begin with a particular section!
