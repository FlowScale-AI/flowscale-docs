# Version v2.0.53

_Released on May 12, 2025_

---

## üöÄ Highlights

**What most people will notice first:**

### Instant Mode-Switch for Advanced Settings

You can flip between "normal" and "power-user" views with one click. The app even detects special FS (FlowScale IO) nodes for you, so you don't hunt for them manually. If you are already using FlowScale IO Nodes, your workflow will be automatically configured for deployment.

### Clear Spending Limits for Pods

Each Pod (think of it as one workspace or mini-server) now shows you its money limit up front.
