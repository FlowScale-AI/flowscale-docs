# Version v2.0.54

_Released on May 21, 2025_

## üöÄ Highlights

**What most people will notice first:**

### Streamlined Node Management

You can now "only save" custom nodes without triggering a reinstall, streamlining node updates and giving you more control over when installations happen.

### Unified Workflow Experience

Workflow editing in the UI has been unified: normal and API JSON schemas are now merged for a single, seamless experience. No more switching between different views!
