## 1. **Organization Setup**

Setting up your organization is the first step after signing up for FlowScale AI. This process ensures you have a workspace to manage your projects, team members, and subscriptions.

### **Steps to Create an Organization**
1. **Sign Up**:  
   Go to [flowscale.ai](https://flowscale.ai) and click the **"Get Started"** button. You will be redirected to a **GitHub login page**, where you must sign up or sign in using your GitHub account.  
   - **Prerequisite**: You must have an existing GitHub account to sign up for FlowScale AI.
   - **GitHub Permissions**: When signing in, you will be prompted to grant permissions so that FlowScale AI can integrate with your GitHub account. This allows FlowScale AI to manage repositories and workflow data seamlessly.

2. **Choose a Subscription Plan**:  
   After signing in, you'll be redirected to the **Pricing Page** where you can choose the **Pro Plan** ($50 per user/month). Fill out your billing information and complete the purchase.

            src="/images/setup/buy-plan.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>

3. **Default Organization Creation**:  
   Once your subscription is confirmed, FlowScale AI automatically creates a **default organization** with your name. This organization will appear in the top-right dropdown of your workspace.

    <Frame caption="Default Organization" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/default-org.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>

### **Managing Your Organization**
1. **Accessing Organization Settings**:  
   Navigate to the **Settings** tab from the main dashboard. Here, you'll see three sub-tabs:  
   - **General**: Manage your organization’s details (name, logo, description).  
   - **Manage Members**: Invite and manage team members.  
   - **Billing & Plans**: Update seat count and subscription plans.

2. **Organization Customization**:  
   In the **General Tab**, you can:  
   - **Update your organization’s logo**.  
   - **Rename your organization** and provide a **description**.  
   - Save changes to reflect the new settings across your account.

    <Frame caption="Organization Settings -> General Tab" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/org-general-settings.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>

### **Managing Multiple Organizations**
- A user can be part of multiple organizations. As a **freelancer or collaborator**, you can be invited to other organizations by their owners.
- You can switch between organizations using the dropdown in the top-right corner of the dashboard.

---

## 2. **Team Management**

After creating your organization, you can invite team members to collaborate on projects. Here's how to manage your team:

### **Steps to Invite Team Members**
1. **Purchase Additional Seats**:  
   By default, your plan comes with **one seat** (yours). To invite more members, you'll need to purchase additional seats:  
   - Go to **Billing & Plans** under the **Settings Tab**.  
   - Click on **Edit Seats**.  
   - Use the input box to increase the number of seats. This will dynamically display the total cost based on the number of additional members.

    <Frame caption="Organization Settings -> Billing & Plans -> Edit Seats" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/org-seats.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>

2. **Add Members**:  
   Once you've purchased additional seats, return to the **Manage Members** tab:  
   - Click **Add Member**.  
   - Enter the **username** of the team member you wish to invite.  
     - The username is located in the top-right corner of the user’s FlowScale account, under their profile.
   - Click **Add Member**.  

    <Frame caption="Organization Settings -> Manage Members -> Add Member" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/org-add-member.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>
    <Frame caption="Provide Member's GitHub username" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/org-add-member-modal.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>
    <Frame caption="Member successfully added!" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/org-added-member.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>

### **Roles and Permissions**
- **Owner**: Has full administrative control over the organization. Can invite/remove team members, edit billing, and create projects.
- **Member**: Can only collaborate on projects they are added to. Members cannot manage billing, team, or organization settings.

## 3. **Project Creation**

Once your organization is set up and team members are added, you can begin creating projects to house your workflows.

### **Steps to Create a Project**
1. **Access the Projects Page**:  
   From the dashboard, navigate to the **Projects** section. Here, you’ll see two options:  
   - **Create ComfyUI Project**: For starting a new project from scratch.  
   - **Import Existing Project**: For importing a project that already exists in GitHub. (This option is useful to import someone else's project or a project you’ve worked on previously.)

    <Frame caption="Get Started with Projects" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/empty-org.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>

2. **Create a New ComfyUI Project**:
   - Click **Create ComfyUI Project**.
   - A popup will prompt you to fill in the **project name**.  
     - Note: **No spaces** are allowed in project names. Use underscores (_) or hyphens (-) instead.
   - Click **Create**. This action automatically creates a **GitHub repository** to store your workflow data.

   <Frame caption="Create a Project" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/create-project-modal.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>
   <Frame caption="Project successfully created!" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/new-project.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>

### **What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
- When you create a project, FlowScale AI generates a **GitHub repository** in your account. This repository stores all your workflows, workflow configurations, and custom nodes list.  
- This approach ensures **full control and ownership** of your data. You can own your workflows, without us having access to them, through GitHub, maintaining complete transparency and security.

## 4. **Collaborator Management**

After creating a project, you can add collaborators to work on it with you. Here's how to manage your collaborators:

### **Adding Collaborators to a Project**
1. **Open Project Settings**:  
   In the project dashboard, click on **Project Settings** in the left-hand menu. You’ll see several tabs, including **Project Collaborators**.
   
   <Frame caption="Project Page -> Settings" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/collab-1.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>

2. **Add Collaborators**:  
   Under **Project Collaborators**, click **Add Collaborator**. Enter the username of the team member you want to add and click **Invite**.

   <Frame caption="Project Settings -> Add Collaborators" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/collab-2.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>
    <Frame caption="Project Settings -> Add Collaborators" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/collab-3.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>
    <Frame caption="Project Settings -> Add Collaborators" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/collab-4.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>

3. **GitHub Invitation**:  
   Once the collaborator is invited, they will receive an email invitation from **GitHub** to access the project’s repository. The collaborator must **accept the GitHub invitation** to gain full access to the project within FlowScale.

   <Frame caption="GitHub Collaborator Invitation" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/setup/collab-invite.png"
            alt="Hero Dark"
        />
    </Frame>

## 5. **GitHub Integration**

FlowScale relies heavily on GitHub for storing and managing workflow data. Here’s a summary of how the integration works:

1. **Data Storage**:  
   Every project you create in FlowScale AI is backed by a GitHub repository. This ensures that your workflow data, and custom nodes are securely stored.

2. **Version Control**:  
   GitHub’s versioning system allows you to manage multiple versions of your workflows.

3. **Collaborator Access**:  
   When collaborators are added to a project in FlowScale AI, they are also added to the corresponding GitHub repository, ensuring they have access to all project data.

### **Conclusion**

Setting up your workspace in FlowScale AI is quick and intuitive. Once your organization is configured and your team members are invited, you're ready to dive into project creation and workflow development. With seamless GitHub integration, FlowScale AI ensures your data is secure, and you retain full control over your AI solutions.
