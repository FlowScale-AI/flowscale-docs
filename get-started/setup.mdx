## 1. **Organization Setup**

Setting up your organization is the first step after signing up for FlowScale. This process ensures you have a workspace to manage your projects, team members, and subscriptions.

### **Steps to Create an Organization**
1. **Sign Up**:  
   Go to [hub.flowscale.ai](https://hub.flowscale.ai) and click the **"Get Started"** button. You will be redirected to a **GitHub login page**, where you must sign up or sign in using your GitHub account.  
   - **Prerequisite**: You must have an existing GitHub account to sign up for FlowScale.
   - **GitHub Permissions**: When signing in, you will be prompted to grant permissions so that FlowScale can integrate with your GitHub account. This allows FlowScale to manage repositories and workflow data seamlessly.

2. **Choose a Subscription Plan**:  
   After signing in, you'll be redirected to the **Pricing Page** where you can choose the **Pro Plan** ($50 per user/month). Fill out your billing information and complete the purchase.

3. **Default Organization Creation**:  
   Once your subscription is confirmed, FlowScale automatically creates a **default organization** with your name. This organization will appear in the top-right dropdown of your workspace.

### **Managing Your Organization**
1. **Accessing Organization Settings**:  
   Navigate to the **Settings** tab from the main dashboard. Here, you'll see three sub-tabs:  
   - **General**: Manage your organization’s details (name, logo, description).  
   - **Manage Members**: Invite and manage team members.  
   - **Billing & Plans**: Update seat count and subscription plans.

2. **Organization Customization**:  
   In the **General Tab**, you can:  
   - **Update your organization’s logo**.  
   - **Rename your organization** and provide a **description**.  
   - Save changes to reflect the new settings across your account.

- You can switch between organizations using the dropdown in the top-right corner of the dashboard.

## 2. **Team Management**

After creating your organization, you can invite team members to collaborate on projects. Here's how to manage your team:

### **Steps to Invite Team Members**
1. **Purchase Additional Seats**:  
   By default, your plan comes with **one seat** (yours). To invite more members, you'll need to purchase additional seats:  
   - Go to **Billing & Plans** under the **Settings Tab**.  
   - Click on **Edit Seats**.  
   - Use the input box to increase the number of seats. This will dynamically display the total cost based on the number of additional members.

   ![Edit Seats](#)  
   _**Screenshot suggestion:** Include an image of the "Edit Seats" dialog box with the pricing displayed._

2. **Invite Members**:  
   Once you've purchased additional seats, return to the **Manage Members** tab:  
   - Click **Add Member**.  
   - Enter the **username** of the team member you wish to invite.  
     - The username is located in the top-right corner of the user’s FlowScale account, under their profile.
   - Click **Invite Member**.  

   ![Add Members](#)  
   _**Screenshot suggestion:** Add a screenshot showing the "Add Member" button and the input field for the username._

### **Roles and Permissions**
- **Owner**: Has full administrative control over the organization. Can invite/remove team members, edit billing, and create projects.
- **Member**: Can only collaborate on projects they are added to. Members cannot manage billing, team, or organization settings.

## 3. **Project Creation**

Once your organization is set up and team members are added, you can begin creating projects to house your workflows.

### **Steps to Create a Project**
1. **Access the Projects Page**:  
   From the dashboard, navigate to the **Projects** section. Here, you’ll see two options:  
   - **Create ComfyUI Project**: For starting a new project from scratch.  
   - **Import Existing Project**: For importing a project that already exists in GitHub.

   ![Create Project](#)  
   _**Screenshot suggestion:** Add an image of the "Create ComfyUI Project" and "Import Existing Project" buttons._

2. **Create a New ComfyUI Project**:
   - Click **Create ComfyUI Project**.
   - A popup will prompt you to fill in the **project name**.  
     - Note: **No spaces** are allowed in project names. Use underscores (_) or hyphens (-) instead.
   - Click **Create**. This action automatically creates a **GitHub repository** to store your workflow data.

   ![New Project Setup](#)  
   _**Screenshot suggestion:** Show the project creation popup with fields for naming and options._

### **What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
- When you create a project, FlowScale generates a **GitHub repository** in your account. This repository stores all your workflow configurations, custom nodes, and models.  
- This approach ensures **full control and ownership** of your data. You can manage your workflows directly through GitHub, maintaining complete transparency and security.

## 4. **Collaborator Management**

After creating a project, you can add collaborators to work on it with you. Here's how to manage your collaborators:

### **Adding Collaborators to a Project**
1. **Open Project Settings**:  
   In the project dashboard, click on **Project Settings** in the left-hand menu. You’ll see several tabs, including **Project Collaborators**.
   
   ![Project Settings](#)  
   _**Screenshot suggestion:** Include a screenshot of the Project Settings page with tabs for "Collaborators" and other settings._

2. **Add Collaborators**:  
   Under **Project Collaborators**, click **Add Collaborator**. Enter the username of the team member you want to add and click **Invite**.

   ![Add Collaborators](#)  
   _**Screenshot suggestion:** Show the "Add Collaborator" button and input fields for entering usernames._

3. **GitHub Invitation**:  
   Once the collaborator is invited, they will receive an email invitation from **GitHub** to access the project’s repository. The collaborator must **accept the GitHub invitation** to gain full access to the project within FlowScale.

   ![GitHub Invitation](#)  
   _**Screenshot suggestion:** Provide an example of a GitHub invitation email for clarity._

## 5. **GitHub Integration**

FlowScale relies heavily on GitHub for storing and managing workflow data. Here’s a summary of how the integration works:

1. **Data Storage**:  
   Every project you create in FlowScale is backed by a GitHub repository. This ensures that your workflow data, models, and custom nodes are securely stored and version-controlled.

2. **Version Control**:  
   GitHub’s versioning system allows you to manage multiple versions of your workflows. You can create branches for different features or rollback to previous versions as needed.

3. **Collaborator Access**:  
   When collaborators are added to a project in FlowScale, they are also added to the corresponding GitHub repository, ensuring they have access to all project data.

### **Conclusion**

Setting up your workspace in FlowScale is quick and intuitive. Once your organization is configured and your team members are invited, you're ready to dive into project creation and workflow development. With seamless GitHub integration, FlowScale ensures your data is secure, and you retain full control over your AI solutions.
