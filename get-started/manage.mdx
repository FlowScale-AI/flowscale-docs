## 1. **Collaboration on Workflows**

FlowScale allows multiple team members to work on the same workflows. While real-time editing isn’t available yet, FlowScale provides efficient ways to collaborate and manage changes.

### **Adding Collaborators to a Project**
To collaborate on a workflow, you need to add team members to your project as **collaborators**:
1. **Add Project Collaborators**:  
   In order to add collaborators, you must be the **project owner**. Follow this documentation to [add a project collaborator](/get-started/setup#4-collaborator-management).
   
2. **Collaborating on Workflows**:  
   After adding collaborators, multiple team members can work on the same ComfyUI instance. However, **real-time updates** and shared editing are not yet available. Team members should avoid editing the same workflow simultaneously to prevent conflicts.

   _**Important**_: When a team member saves changes to a workflow, others must refresh the workflow list on the left side of the editor to see the updates. This ensures that everyone is working on the most current version.

          alt="Hero Dark"
      />
    </Frame>

### **Permissions for Collaborators**
- **Owner**: The project owner has full control and can add/remove collaborators. They are also responsible for managing project settings.
- **Collaborators**: Can make all changes to workflows (e.g., edit workflows, add/remove nodes, manage models) but cannot add or remove other collaborators.

## 2. **Workflow Versioning**

Tracking changes in workflows is crucial for ensuring that different versions are properly managed. In FlowScale AI, every workflow save is versioned via GitHub commits.

### **Saving Workflow Versions**
1. **Make Changes**:  
   Open a workflow and make the necessary changes. When you’re done, click **Save Changes** on the action bar.
   
   <Frame caption="Action Bar" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
      <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/manage/actions-bar.png"
          alt="Hero Dark"
      />
   </Frame>

2. **Provide a Commit Message**:  
   A dialog box will appear prompting you to enter a **commit message**. This message describes the changes made to the workflow.
   
   <Frame caption="Commit Message" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
      <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/manage/commit-message-modal.png"
          alt="Hero Dark"
      />
   </Frame>

3. **Version Creation**:  
   Each time you save, the workflow is saved as a new **version**. These versions are tied to GitHub commits, allowing you to track changes over time.

### **Viewing and Managing Workflow Versions**
1. **Change History**:  
   To view the version history of a workflow:
   - Open the **Workflows** tab in the left sidebar.
   - Hover over the workflow and click the **triple dot menu**.
   - Select **Change History** to see all saved versions and changes.

   <Frame caption="Change History Option" style={{marginBottom: '10px', width: '60%'}}>
      <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/manage/change-history-options.png"
          alt="Hero Dark"
      />
   </Frame>
   <Frame caption="Change History" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
      <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/manage/change-history-modal.png"
          alt="Hero Dark"
      />
   </Frame>

2. **Viewing Commit Details**:  
   To see detailed changes, click the version you want to inspect. This will open the commit on GitHub, where you can view the workflow’s JSON file changes. 
   
   _**Tip**: Focus on the **API JSON file** in GitHub, as it tracks meaningful workflow changes without recording positional adjustments like node placement._

   <Frame caption="View Commit" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
      <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/manage/view-version.png"
          alt="Hero Dark"
      />
   </Frame>
   <Frame caption="Commit Details" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
      <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/manage/git-commit-diff.png"
          alt="Hero Dark"
      />
   </Frame>

### **Restoring Previous Versions**
At this time, FlowScale AI does not support the ability to **restore** previous versions directly in the UI. However, you can view older commits and manually recreate a workflow based on the version history.

## 3. **GitHub Integration**

FlowScale AI deeply integrates with GitHub to securely manage and version workflows. Each project in FlowScale AI corresponds to a GitHub repository, ensuring that users maintain full control of their workflow data.

### **How GitHub Integration Works**
1. **Project Repositories**:  
   When you create a project in FlowScale AI, a corresponding **GitHub repository** is created under your account. This repository holds all your workflow data and ensures that you have complete control over your intellectual property.

   <Frame caption="View GitHub Repo" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
      <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/manage/view-on-github-button.png"
          alt="Hero Dark"
      />
   </Frame>
   <Frame caption="Commit Details" style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
      <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/manage/github-repo.png"
          alt="Hero Dark"
      />
   </Frame>

2. **Committing Changes**:  
   Every time you **save** a workflow, FlowScale AI automatically pushes the changes as a **GitHub commit**. This keeps the repository updated without any manual effort.

### **How GitHub Commits Are Tied to Workflow Changes**
Each commit represents a version of the workflow. When you save a workflow, the changes are automatically committed to GitHub, ensuring traceability. Users can view commit details in the **Change History** section or directly on GitHub.

## 4. **Model and Node Management**

Managing AI models and nodes is essential for ensuring that your workflows run smoothly, regardless of the version. In FlowScale AI, models and nodes are managed separately from workflow versions.

### **Managing AI Models and Nodes Across Workflows**
- **AI Models** and **Custom Nodes** are managed independently of workflows. This means that changes to models or nodes do not directly affect individual workflow versions.
- The **Models** and **Nodes** tabs on the left sidebar allow users to manage models and nodes for all workflows within the project.

### **Shared Library of Models**
- **Models**:  
   FlowScale AI provides a shared library for **public models** (available to all users) and **private models** (uploaded by the user). These models are accessible across all projects, not limited to a specific one.
   
   You can check out this document to learn more about [managing models](/get-started/manage#managing-ai-models-and-nodes-across-workflows).

### **Updating Nodes Without Affecting Workflows**
- Users must manually ensure that any **custom nodes** required for workflows are not deleted or changed without consideration. Deleting a node may cause existing workflows to fail.
- If you delete a node and suspect it may affect a workflow, re-import the workflow to trigger an analysis of required nodes. This process will detect and reinstall any missing nodes.

   You can check out this document to learn more about [building workflows and adding custom nodes](/get-started/build#step-by-step-instructions-for-building-a-new-workflow-from-scratch).

   _**Tip**: Keep the number of installed nodes below 35-40 to ensure the best performance. Having too many nodes (especially complex nodes like Mixlab, etc) can slow down your machine’s cold start time._

### **Conclusion**

Managing workflows in FlowScale AI is a robust process that allows collaboration, detailed versioning, and secure GitHub integration. By following these best practices, teams can efficiently build, manage, and deploy complex AI workflows without compromising performance or workflow integrity.
