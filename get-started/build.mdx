## 1. **Accessing ComfyUI**

After creating your first project in FlowScale, you can easily access and start ComfyUI to build your AI workflows.

### **Steps to Start ComfyUI on FlowScale**
1. **Sign in to FlowScale** and open the **Projects** page.
2. **Select your project**. Once you click on a project, you’ll land on the **workflow editor screen**.
   - At the top, you’ll see the **project name** and **organization name**.
   - The **left sidebar** has three main tabs:  
     - **Workflows**: Manage and organize your workflows within folders.
     - **Models**: Access public or private AI models for your workflows.
     - **Nodes**: Manage custom ComfyUI nodes required for building workflows.
     
   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Include an annotated image of the workflow editor screen, highlighting the project name, organization, and sidebar tabs._

3. On the right side of the screen, there’s a **“Start ComfyUI”** button.  
   - Click this button to launch ComfyUI.  
   - Once clicked, an action bar will appear at the bottom, displaying a message: **“ComfyUI Starting, please wait.”**
   - A **loader** will indicate the startup process, and logs will be displayed at the bottom to monitor system activities.
   
   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Show the location of the "Start ComfyUI" button and the action bar with the startup message._

4. After the instance is fully set up, the **ComfyUI interface** will appear, ready for workflow building.

### **Running ComfyUI on Cloud GPUs**
By default, ComfyUI starts on a **T4 GPU**, but you can change the GPU type in your project’s settings.
1. **Open Project Settings**:  
   Navigate to the **Project Settings** tab and go to **GPU Settings**.
   
2. **Select GPU Type**:  
   - You’ll see a **GPU Type dropdown**. By default, the **T4** is selected.
   - Available options include:  
     - T4 (default)
     - L4
     - A100 40 GB
     - A100 80 GB
     - H100
     - A10G

3. **Switch GPU**:  
   Select a different GPU type, **save changes**, return to the editor, and click the **“Stop”** button to stop the current ComfyUI instance.
   - Click **“Start ComfyUI”** again to launch the new instance with the selected GPU.

   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Add an image of the "GPU Settings" screen with the dropdown showing available GPUs._

## 2. **Building Workflows**

FlowScale allows users to build workflows either from scratch or by importing existing workflows. This section covers both options in detail.

### **Step-by-Step Instructions for Building a New Workflow from Scratch**
1. **Launch ComfyUI**:  
   After starting ComfyUI, a **default workflow** is automatically loaded into the editor.
   - The workflow is labeled **“Untitled Workflow”**, and a star icon indicates that the workflow is unsaved.

   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Show the default ComfyUI workflow interface with an annotation of the “Untitled Workflow” and the star icon._

2. **Editing the Workflow**:  
   - Make any changes to the default workflow.  
   - When changes are made, the **“Save Changes”** button on the action bar will become active.

3. **Add AI Models**:  
   Switch to the **Models** tab on the left sidebar to select AI models. You can choose from FlowScale’s **public models** or upload **private models**.
   - To access public models, simply select **Public Models** from the dropdown.
   - To add private models, follow the steps in the [Private and Public Models](#managing-private-and-public-models) section below.

   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Add an image of the Models tab showing the dropdown for public and private models._

4. **Add Custom Nodes**:  
   Use the **Nodes** tab in the sidebar to add custom nodes required for the workflow.
   - Click the **“+”** button to add new nodes.  
   - You can search for popular custom nodes by name, and FlowScale will automatically pull the required GitHub repository for installation.

   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Show the Nodes tab with the “Add Custom Node” option._

5. **Save Your Workflow**:  
   Once your workflow is complete, click **“Save Changes”** on the action bar. A popup will appear asking for:  
   - **Workflow Name**  
   - **Select Path** (Choose or create a folder in the workflow tab to save the workflow)  
   - **Description** of the workflow

   After saving, two files will be created in the selected folder:  
   - The **main workflow file** (for ComfyUI).  
   - An **API JSON file**, which will be used for future API deployments.

   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Add an image of the “Save Changes” popup, showing the fields for workflow name, folder, and description._

### **Importing Existing ComfyUI Workflows into FlowScale**
1. **Import a Workflow**:  
   In the **Workflows** tab, click the **“+”** button and select **“Import Workflow”**.  
   - A dialog box will open, prompting you to upload a **workflow file (JSON)** from your local machine.
   
   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Show the “Import Workflow” button and the upload dialog box._

2. **Analyze and Install Nodes**:  
   After uploading the workflow, FlowScale will automatically analyze it. This process identifies:  
   - **Custom nodes** that need to be installed.  
   - **Conflicting nodes** (if there are duplicate or overlapping nodes).  
   
   Select the nodes you want to install, then click **Confirm**.

   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Include a screenshot of the Analyze tab showing custom and conflicting nodes._

3. **Install Nodes**:  
   To ensure the nodes from the imported workflow are fully installed, you can:
   - Shut down the current ComfyUI instance, then **restart ComfyUI**. This will automatically install all nodes.
   - Alternatively, click the **three-dot menu** on individual nodes in the **Nodes tab** and select **Reinstall**.

## 3. **Cloud GPU Usage**

FlowScale supports running ComfyUI workflows on cloud GPUs. Managing your GPU usage effectively ensures cost-efficiency and optimal performance.

### **Checking GPU Usage**
1. **Monitoring GPU Activity**:  
   At the **top right of the screen**, there’s a **Credits** indicator.  
   - A **green dot** next to the credits indicates that the GPU is currently in use.  
   - A **gray dot** means the GPU is idle, and you are not being charged for usage.

   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Highlight the Credits section showing the green and gray status dots._

2. **Viewing GPU Type in Use**:  
   The GPU type being used (e.g., T4) is displayed in the **action bar** at the bottom of the screen. This helps you track which GPU is being charged.

   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Add an image of the action bar showing the GPU type in use._

### **Limits and Usage Caps**
- Currently, there are **no usage caps or limits** on GPU usage for specific plans.
- However, be mindful of the GPU type you select as higher-end GPUs incur greater costs.

## 4. **Managing Private and Public Models**

FlowScale allows users to work with both public and private AI models. Public models are available by default, while private models can be added manually.

### **Adding Public Models**
1. Go to the **Models** tab on the left sidebar.
2. Select **Public Models** from the dropdown.  
   - These models are supported by FlowScale out of the box and can be used in any workflow.

   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Show the Models tab with the dropdown showing Public Models._

### **Adding Private Models**
1. To add a private model, switch to **Private Models** in the dropdown.
2. Click the **“+”** button to add a new folder for organizing your private models (e.g., “Checkpoints” or “ControlNet”).
3. Inside the folder, click the **three-dot menu** and select **Upload** to add a new model file.
4. You can search

 for models using the **search bar** provided, or directly upload a model from your machine.
   - If you are uploading a model from **CivitAI**, you will need to enter your **CivitAI API key** to complete the download.

   _**Screenshot Suggestion**: Add images showing how to create folders, upload models, and enter API keys._

5. Once uploaded, click **Refresh** on the action bar to see the new model in ComfyUI.
