# FlowScale AI API Reference

**You've deployed ComfyUI workflows as production APIsâ€”now harness their full power.** This comprehensive reference shows you how to integrate FlowScale AI's enterprise-grade infrastructure into your applications, automation systems, and business processes.

**Why this API matters for your business:** Instead of managing local ComfyUI installations, dependency conflicts, and scaling challenges, you now have access to production-ready AI infrastructure that scales from prototype to enterprise workloads seamlessly.

## From Creative Workflow to Business Infrastructure

**The FlowScale AI API transforms your ComfyUI workflows into scalable business infrastructure.** What started as creative experiments in ComfyUI now becomes reliable, governed services that can power applications, automate business processes, and serve customers at global scale.

**This isn't just another APIâ€”it's your AI workflows as enterprise infrastructure:** Programmatically trigger complex AI processes, monitor their execution in real-time, and integrate sophisticated AI capabilities into any application or automation system without managing the underlying complexity.

## Key Features

- **Health Monitoring:** Continuously check the status of all ComfyUI instances to ensure optimal performance and uptime.
- **Queue Management:** Retrieve and manage queue data for running and pending tasks across ComfyUI instances.
- **Workflow Execution:** Execute complex workflows with dynamic form data, including support for file uploads and text inputs.
- **Run Tracking:** Monitor the status and details of each workflow execution, ensuring transparency and traceability.
- **Output Retrieval:** Access the results of your workflows, whether they are images, videos, audio files, or text data, with secure download links.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Automatically balances load across available ComfyUI instances based on real-time queue sizes.
- **Secure Access:** Implements robust API key authentication to safeguard your workflows and data.

## Security and Authentication

Security is paramount in the FlowScale's ComfyUI API. All endpoints are protected using **API Key Authentication**, ensuring that only authorized users can access and interact with the API. The API key must be included in the request headers as follows:

- **Header Name:** `X-API-KEY`
- **Header Value:** Your unique API key (string)

### Authentication Flow

1. **API Key Validation:** Each request must include a valid API key. The API validates this key and then allows access to the relevant data on successful authentication.
2. **Access Control:** If the API key is missing, invalid, or does not match the expected value, the API will respond with appropriate error messages (`401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`).

## From Deployment to Integration

**Ready to integrate your deployed workflows into real applications?** This API reference assumes you've already completed the deployment process and are ready to build production integrations.
