## Managing Environment Variables

Environment variables enable users to configure project settings dynamically, giving workflows access to essential credentials and configurations without hardcoding sensitive information.

### Steps to Add Environment Variables

1. **Navigate to the Project Settings**:
   - Access your project’s **Settings** section.
   
2. **Add Environment Variables**:
   - Go to the **Environment Settings** section.
   - Enter the variable **name** and **value**. For sensitive values, select options to hide them.

3. **Save and Apply**:
   - Save your changes. The variables will automatically be accessible within the project's workflows.

### Benefits of Environment Variables

- **Security**: Store sensitive data securely, avoiding direct exposure within code.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adjust variables to adapt workflows to various environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- **Centralized Management**: Keep all credentials and configuration settings in one place for simplified management.

## Managing API Keys

Flowscale’s API key management enables secure access to APIs deployed within the platform, allowing workflows and external tools to interact with deployed resources.

### Steps to Add and Manage API Keys

1. **Access the API Settings Section**:
   - Go to the **API Settings** under Project Settings.
   - A unique **API Key** is autogenerated for each project, enabling secure access to APIs.

2. **Regenerate API Key**:
   - If needed, click **Regenerate** to create a new API key. Note that deployments must be restarted for the new key to take effect.

3. **Adjust API Access Permissions**:
   - To make APIs publicly accessible, deselect the checkbox for **Keep only accessible through API Key**. This option allows anyone to access the APIs without requiring the key.

### Benefits of Managing API Keys

- **Enhanced Security**: Control API access to prevent unauthorized interactions with deployed resources.
- **Flexible Access Control**: Choose whether to restrict API access through API keys or allow public access based on project requirements.
