## Key Features

- **Workflow Creation**: Easily start new workflows from scratch or import existing ones to enhance or build upon prior work.
- **Modular Design**: Construct workflows step-by-step with individual nodes that are customizable and flexible, allowing for easy modification or extension.
- **Collaboration**: Share workflows with team members, enabling collaborative development and real-time updates.
- **Version Control**: Track changes over time with built-in versioning, simplifying the process of managing updates and iterations.
- **Organization**: Keep workflows structured within folders or categories for better organization and quicker access.

## How to Use Workflows

### 1. Create a Folder for Organization

- Navigate to the **Workflows** section.
- Click on the **+** icon and select **Add New Folder** to organize your workflows by category, making it easier to manage multiple workflows within a project.

### 2. Create a New Workflow

- Within the **Workflows** section, click on the **+** icon and select **Create New Workflow**.
- Design and modify the workflow using the embedded ComfyUI interface, which provides a visual layout of nodes and connections.
- After configuring your workflow, save your changes to preserve the setup.

### 3. Import Existing Workflows

- Use the **Import Workflow** option inside the **+** menu to bring in workflows from other projects or external sources.
- This functionality allows you to import external workflows into your current project.
- Select the workflow you want to import
