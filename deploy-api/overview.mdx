# From Workflow to Widely-Usable Service

You've validated a ComfyUI workflow. The results look great in the FlowScale AI builder — now the questions start:

- **Can my app call this workflow programmatically?**
- **Can I let non-technical teams try variations without breaking anything?**
- **How do we control cost when demand spikes?**
- **What changes between a demo link and a production SLA?**

This section shows how FlowScale AI turns a saved workflow into a **deployable service surface** you can use in three ways:

| Use Case | Best Surface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Quick reviews, creative iteration | **Playground UI** | Guardrails + presets; zero code. |
| Product / tool integration | **API or SDK** | Stable contract, versioned schema, auth. |
| Automation, batch, agents | **SDK + Scaling controls** | Queues, concurrency, budget caps. |

<Callout type="info">
Ready to move from "prototype in ComfyUI" to "operational API your teams can trust"? If you haven't yet, start with [Why FlowScale AI?](/getting-started/why-flowscale-ai) to understand the strategic context this section delivers on.

## What You'll Learn

After completing this section, you'll be able to:

1. **Configure Deployments:** Turn a validated ComfyUI workflow into a governed deployment target with runtime controls, auth scopes, and budget caps.
2. **Launch Playground UIs:** Create ready-to-share interfaces for internal demos, reviews, or lightweight production use.
3. **Call Workflows from Code:** Consume deployments programmatically via FlowScale AI SDKs (JS/TS & Python) or direct REST calls.
4. **Scale & Govern:** Auto-scale GPUs, control costs, and monitor performance using FlowScale AI's scaling primitives.

## Mental Model

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/deploy/deployment-tab.png"
    alt="Workflow deployment flow: artifact → configuration → surfaces → governance"
  />
</Frame>

Every deployed workflow in FlowScale AI follows this progression:

**Workflow Artifact** (your ComfyUI graph + assets)  
→ **Deployment Configuration** (runtime, schema, permissions)  
→ **Service Surfaces** (API endpoint, Playground UI, SDK bindings)  
→ **Scale & Governance** (metrics, scaling, budgets)

### Try It Now: SDK Examples

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
import FlowScale from '@flowscale/sdk';

const client = new FlowScale({
  apiKey: 'fs_your_api_key_here'
});

const result = await client.run({
  workflowId: 'text-to-image-v1',
  inputs: {
    prompt: 'A serene mountain landscape at sunset',
    width: 1024,
    height: 1024
  }
});

console.log(result.images[0].url);
```

```python Python
import flowscale

client = flowscale.Client(api_key="fs_your_api_key_here")

result = client.run(
    workflow_id="text-to-image-v1",
    inputs={
        "prompt": "A serene mountain landscape at sunset",
        "width": 1024,
        "height": 1024
    }
)

print(result.images[0].url)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.flowscale.ai/v1/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fs_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workflow_id": "text-to-image-v1",
    "inputs": {
      "prompt": "A serene mountain landscape at sunset",
      "width": 1024,
      "height": 1024
    }
  }'

## Service Surfaces Explained

### API Endpoints
**When to use:** Product integration, backend automation, webhook triggers

**Key features:**
- RESTful HTTP interface with auto-generated OpenAPI docs
- Strongly-typed input validation and structured outputs
- Authentication via API keys with fine-grained permissions
- Async job support for long-running workflows

### Playground UIs
**When to use:** Creative review cycles, stakeholder demos, non-technical team access

**Key features:**
- Auto-generated interfaces based on workflow parameters
- Parameter presets and validation guardrails
- Shareable links with access controls
- Usage logging for compliance and billing

### SDK Integration
**When to use:** Application development, batch processing, programmatic automation

**Key features:**
- Type-safe clients for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python
- Built-in retry logic and error handling
- Streaming support for real-time outputs
- Environment-specific best practices (frontend vs. server)

## Leadership Snapshots

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cost & Governance Controls">
    Every deployment can carry soft budgets and hard caps. When you hit thresholds, FlowScale AI can throttle, alert, or block — preventing runaway GPU spend during experimentation. Teams get creative freedom within defined financial boundaries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Brand Consistency Assurance">
    Lock model checkpoints and parameter ranges so all business units render within approved creative bounds. Deploy once with guardrails, then trust teams to iterate safely without brand risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security & Compliance Posture">
    All deployments include HTTPS-only communication, configurable data retention policies, audit logging, and SOC 2 compliance. Integration patterns support your existing authentication and authorization systems.
