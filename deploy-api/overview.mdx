# From Workflow to Widely-Usable Service

You've validated a ComfyUI workflow. The results look great in the FlowScale AI builder — now the questions start:

- **Can my app call this workflow programmatically?**
- **Can I let non-technical teams try variations without breaking anything?**
- **How do we control cost when demand spikes?**
- **What changes between a demo link and a production SLA?**

This section shows how FlowScale AI turns a saved workflow into a **deployable service surface** you can use in three ways:

| Use Case | Best Surface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Quick reviews, creative iteration | **Playground UI** | Guardrails + presets; zero code. |
| Product / tool integration | **API or SDK** | Stable contract, versioned schema, auth. |
| Automation, batch, agents | **SDK + Scaling controls** | Queues, concurrency, budget caps. |

<Note>
**Coming from the Getting Started guides?** Perfect! You've already experienced the journey from ComfyUI workflow to deployed service. This section shows you how to master the production-grade features that make your deployments enterprise-ready.

**New to FlowScale AI?** Start with [Why FlowScale AI?](/getting-started/why-flowscale-ai) to understand the strategic context, then work through [Import/Create Workflows](/getting-started/import-create-workflows) and [Deploy Workflows](/getting-started/deploy-workflows) to get hands-on experience before diving into these advanced capabilities.

## What You'll Learn

After completing this section, you'll be able to:

1. **Configure Deployments:** Turn a validated ComfyUI workflow into a governed deployment target with runtime controls, auth scopes, and budget caps.
2. **Launch Playground UIs:** Create ready-to-share interfaces for internal demos, reviews, or lightweight production use.
3. **Call Workflows from Code:** Consume deployments programmatically via FlowScale AI SDKs (JS/TS & Python) or direct REST calls.
4. **Scale & Govern:** Auto-scale GPUs, control costs, and monitor performance using FlowScale AI's scaling primitives.

## Mental Model

<Frame>
  <img

    alt="FlowScale deployment flow showing progression from workflow to production service"
  />
</Frame>

{/* Image Description for Team: Conceptual diagram showing deployment progression from workflow artifact through configuration, service surfaces, to scale & governance */}

Every deployed workflow in FlowScale AI follows this progression:

**Workflow Artifact** (your ComfyUI graph + assets)  
→ **Deployment Configuration** (runtime, schema, permissions)  
→ **Service Surfaces** (API endpoint, Playground UI, SDK bindings)  
→ **Scale & Governance** (metrics, scaling, budgets)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Test with Playground">
    Generate **Playground Link** and test parameter variations with guardrails
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call from Code">
    Copy the **API Endpoint** → paste into SDK quick start examples below

### Try It Now: SDK Examples

<Tip>
**Already deployed a workflow?** These examples will work with your deployed workflow—just replace the `workflowId` with your actual workflow ID from the API Server page.

**Haven't deployed yet?** Complete the [Deploy Workflows guide](/getting-started/deploy-workflows) first to get your workflow running as an API, then return here to see how to integrate it into applications.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
import FlowScale from '@flowscale/sdk';

const client = new FlowScale({
  apiKey: 'fs_your_api_key_here'
});

const result = await client.run({
  workflowId: 'text-to-image-v1',
  inputs: {
    prompt: 'A serene mountain landscape at sunset',
    width: 1024,
    height: 1024
  }
});

console.log(result.images[0].url);
```

```python Python
import flowscale

client = flowscale.Client(api_key="fs_your_api_key_here")

result = client.run(
    workflow_id="text-to-image-v1",
    inputs={
        "prompt": "A serene mountain landscape at sunset",
        "width": 1024,
        "height": 1024
    }
)

print(result.images[0].url)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.flowscale.ai/v1/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fs_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workflow_id": "text-to-image-v1",
    "inputs": {
      "prompt": "A serene mountain landscape at sunset",
      "width": 1024,
      "height": 1024
    }
  }'

## Leadership Snapshots

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cost & Governance Controls">
    Every deployment can carry soft budgets and hard caps. When you hit thresholds, FlowScale AI can throttle, alert, or block — preventing runaway GPU spend during experimentation. Teams get creative freedom within defined financial boundaries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Brand Consistency Assurance">
    Lock model checkpoints and parameter ranges so all business units render within approved creative bounds. Deploy once with guardrails, then trust teams to iterate safely without brand risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security & Compliance Posture">
    All deployments include HTTPS-only communication, configurable data retention policies, audit logging, and SOC 2 compliance. Integration patterns support your existing authentication and authorization systems.
