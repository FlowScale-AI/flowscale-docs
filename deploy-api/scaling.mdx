# Scale, Observe, and Control Cost/Performance

Your workflow is deployed and accessible via API and Playground UI. Now you need it to **handle real usage patterns**: traffic spikes during product launches, batch processing jobs overnight, and cost optimization during quiet periods.

This page covers FlowScale AI's **scaling primitives**: horizontal scaling, autoscale triggers, warm pools, queue depth behavior, cost levers, SLA monitoring, and the operational tools that ensure your AI workflows perform reliably under production load.

<Callout type="info">
**For Engineering Leadership:** Focus on [SLA Guarantees](#sla-guarantees--monitoring) and [Cost Optimization](#cost-optimization-levers).
**For Developers:** See [Auto-Scaling Configuration](#auto-scaling-configuration) for technical implementation.
**For AI & Creative Leads:** Review [Performance vs Cost Trade-offs](#performance-vs-cost-trade-offs) for budget planning.

## Scaling Modes Overview

| Scaling Mode | Best For | Cost Profile | Latency Profile | Management Overhead |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fixed Scaling** | Predictable workloads, demos | Highest (always running) | Lowest (instant response) | Minimal |
| **Auto-Scaling** | Variable traffic, production apps | Balanced (scales with demand) | Low (warm pool available) | Low |
| **Batch Scaling** | Background jobs, data processing | Lowest (spot pricing) | Variable (queue-based) | Medium |
| **On-Demand** | Development, occasional use | Pay-per-use | Highest (cold start penalty) | Minimal |

<Accordion title="E-commerce Product Images: $500/month → $180/month">
**Scenario:** 10,000 product images generated monthly

**Before Optimization:**
- Fixed 2x A10G instances: $1,728/month
- 70% idle time during off-hours
- No caching (many similar product types)

**After Optimization:**
- Auto-scaling with 1-8 A10G instances

- Batch processing during off-peak hours
- **Result:** 65% cost reduction, same quality/speed
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Marketing Campaign: $2,000/month → $800/month">
**Scenario:** Variable load with campaign spikes

**Before Optimization:**
- Over-provisioned for peak capacity
- Manual scaling during campaign launches
- Separate instances per campaign

**After Optimization:**  
- Predictive warm pool scaling
- Shared GPU pool across campaigns
- Spot instances for batch asset generation
- **Result:** 60% cost reduction, better performance during spikes

## Troubleshooting & Optimization

### Common Scaling Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cold Start Latency Problems">
    **Symptoms:** Initial requests taking 30-90 seconds, poor user experience
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Increase warm pool size during peak hours
    - Use predictive scaling based on historical patterns
    - Implement model pre-loading and caching
    - Consider keeping 1 instance always-warm for critical deployments
    
    **Monitoring:** Track cold start frequency and duration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cost Overruns">
    **Symptoms:** Monthly bills exceeding budget, unexpected scaling events
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Implement hard budget limits with automatic shut-off
    - Review scaling triggers for over-aggressive scaling
    - Enable output caching to reduce redundant processing
    - Use spot instances for non-critical workloads
    
    **Prevention:** Set up proactive budget alerts at 50%, 75%, 90%
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Queue Backup During Spikes">
    **Symptoms:** Long wait times, user timeouts, poor experience during high traffic

    - Increase maximum instance count temporarily
    - Implement request prioritization (paid vs free users)
    - Add geographic load balancing
