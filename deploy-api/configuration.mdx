---

To deploy a workflow as an API or playground UI, you must configure the workflow's input and output parameters. By default, the FlowScale platform doesn't automatically determine which nodes should serve as input and output endpoints - this must be explicitly configured.

<Note>
Workflows that haven't been configured for deployment will show a **red cross mark** in your project's workflow sidebar. Properly configured workflows display a **green checkmark**.
</Note>

## Configuration Methods

There are two ways to configure your workflow for deployment:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="FlowScale I/O Nodes (Recommended)">
Use specialized FlowScale I/O nodes designed specifically for deployment configuration. This is the simplest and most straightforward approach.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Advanced API Configuration">
Use the advanced configuration interface for complex setups that require granular control over input/output parameters.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Method 1: FlowScale I/O Nodes

The recommended approach uses FlowScale's specialized input and output nodes, which are prefixed with `[FS]` in the node search.

### Adding Input Nodes

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Node Search">
Double-click on an empty area in the ComfyUI workspace to open the node search dialog
</Step>
<Step title="Search for Input Nodes">
Type one of the following input node names:
- **InputText** - For text prompts and string inputs
- **InputImage** - For image uploads
- **InputNumber** - For numeric parameters
- **InputSlider** - For slider controls
</Step>
<Step title="Select FlowScale Nodes">
Choose nodes with the **"[FS]"** prefix, indicating they are FlowScale-specific nodes
</Step>
<Step title="Connect to Workflow">
Connect these input nodes to your workflow where external inputs are needed
</Step>
</Steps>

### Adding Output Nodes

<Steps>
<Step title="Search for Output Nodes">
In the node search, type one of the following output node names:
- **SaveImage** - For image outputs
- **SaveText** - For text outputs
- **SaveVideo** - For video outputs
- **SaveAudio** - For audio outputs
</Step>
<Step title="Select FlowScale Nodes">
Choose nodes with the **"[FS]"** prefix
</Step>
<Step title="Connect to Workflow">
Connect these output nodes to capture the final results of your workflow
</Step>
</Steps>

### Available FlowScale I/O Nodes

| Node Type | Purpose | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **[FS] InputText** | Text input field | Prompts, descriptions, parameters |
| **[FS] InputImage** | Image upload | Reference images, masks, source images |
| **[FS] InputNumber** | Numeric input | Steps, strength, dimensions |
| **[FS] InputSlider** | Range slider | CFG scale, denoise strength |
| **[FS] SaveImage** | Image output | Generated images, processed images |
| **[FS] SaveText** | Text output | Generated text, metadata |
| **[FS] SaveVideo** | Video output | Animated sequences |
| **[FS] SaveAudio** | Audio output | Generated audio files |

</Note>

### Verify Configuration

After adding FlowScale I/O nodes:

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect All Nodes">
Ensure all I/O nodes are properly connected to your workflow
</Step>
<Step title="Save Workflow">
Click the **Save** button in the ComfyUI workspace
</Step>
<Step title="Check Status">
Look for a **green checkmark** next to your workflow in the left sidebar, indicating successful configuration
</Step>
</Steps>

## Method 2: Advanced API Configuration

For more complex scenarios or when you need granular control over the API configuration, you can use the Advanced API Settings.

### Accessing Advanced Settings

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Workflow Options">
Click the **three dots icon** next to your workflow in the left sidebar
</Step>
<Step title="Select Advanced API Settings">
Click on **"Advanced API Settings"** from the dropdown menu
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Advanced Mode">
Toggle the switch to enable Advanced API Settings mode. This overrides the default FlowScale nodes method.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
By default, Advanced API Settings are disabled because the platform uses FlowScale I/O nodes as the primary configuration method. Enable this only when you need advanced control.
</Warning>

### Configuring Input and Output Nodes

Once Advanced API Settings are enabled, you'll see a dialog with two columns:

<Steps>
<Step title="Select Input Nodes">
In the **left column**, select all nodes that should serve as input endpoints for your API
</Step>
<Step title="Select Output Nodes">
In the **right column**, select all nodes that should serve as output endpoints for your API
</Step>
<Step title="Configure Parameters">
For each selected node:
- All available parameters will be displayed with prefilled values from the workflow
- **Check the parameters** you want to include in the API
- Add **parameter labels** that will be displayed in the playground UI
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important**: Simply selecting a node is not enough. You must also check the specific parameters you want to include. If no parameters are selected for a node, it will not be considered as an input/output.
</Warning>

### Parameter Configuration

For each selected parameter, you can configure:

- **Parameter inclusion**: Check the box to include the parameter in the API
- **Parameter label**: The display name shown in the playground UI
- **Default values**: Pre-filled from your workflow configuration

## Impact on API and Playground

The I/O configuration directly affects:

### API Generation
- **Input parameters** become the API request payload structure
- **Output parameters** define the API response format
- **Parameter types** determine validation and documentation

### Playground UI
- **Input fields** are automatically generated based on configured input nodes
- **Output displays** are created for each configured output node
- **Parameter labels** are used as field names in the interface

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Node Selection">
- Use descriptive parameter labels for better user experience
- Only expose parameters that users should control
- Keep the number of input parameters manageable
- Ensure all critical outputs are captured
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Testing Configuration">
- Test your configuration with the FlowScale I/O nodes first
- Verify the playground UI reflects your intended interface
- Run test API calls to validate input/output structure
- Check that all parameters behave as expected
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced vs Simple">
- Start with FlowScale I/O nodes for most use cases
- Use Advanced API Configuration only when you need:
  - Custom parameter grouping
  - Complex validation rules
  - Integration with existing workflow nodes
  - Granular control over API structure
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deploy Your Workflow

Once your workflow is configured (showing a green checkmark), you can deploy it.

### Deployment Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Click Deploy">
Click the **"Deploy"** button in the top-right corner of the application

</Step>

<Step title="Select Pod">
A dialog box will appear asking you to select the Pod for deployment

</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Configuration">
Select the appropriate pod based on your workflow requirements:
- **GPU type** needed for your models
- **Memory requirements** for your workflow
- **Expected usage** patterns
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Deployment">
Click **Deploy** to start the deployment process
</Step>
</Steps>
