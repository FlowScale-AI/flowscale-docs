**This is the moment your technical AI workflow becomes accessible to everyone.** Playground UIs transform your sophisticated ComfyUI creations into polished, user-friendly interfaces that anyone can useâ€”no technical knowledge required.

<Tip>
**The "aha" moment:** Watch non-technical team members, clients, or stakeholders use your complex AI workflows as easily as filling out a web form. What took you hours to perfect in ComfyUI now takes them seconds to use effectively.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Automatic Magic:** Every workflow you deploy instantly generates its own playground. No additional configuration, no UI development, no user training required. Your ComfyUI logic becomes a professional web application automatically.
</Note>

## Playground Interface

### Interface Design: Complexity Hidden, Power Preserved

**Here's where thoughtful design shines:** Your playground presents a clean, intuitive interface that hides all the ComfyUI complexity while preserving every bit of your workflow's creative power.

<Note>
**Design philosophy:** Users see only what they need to control, in language they understand, with guardrails that prevent mistakes. Your sophisticated AI logic becomes as approachable as any consumer web application.
</Note>

### Input Field Types

The input fields in your playground directly correspond to the FlowScale I/O nodes you configured:

| Input Node Type | Playground Control | Description |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **[FS] InputText** | Text area/field | Multi-line or single-line text input |
| **[FS] InputImage** | File upload | Drag-and-drop or click to upload images |
| **[FS] InputNumber** | Number input | Numeric field with validation |
| **[FS] InputSlider** | Range slider | Interactive slider with min/max values |

ðŸ’¡ **Lightbulb Moment:** The input fields you see are exactly the parameters you chose to expose when configuring your workflow. This is where your thoughtful I/O design pays offâ€”users see an intuitive interface because you made intentional choices about what to show and what to keep internal.

<Tip>
**Interface refinement:** If the playground doesn't feel quite right, you can always refine your [workflow I/O configuration](/deploy-api/configuration) to better match your users' needs. Great interfaces evolve through real user feedback.
</Tip>

## GPU Status Monitoring

### Understanding GPU States

The top-right corner of every playground displays real-time GPU status information:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Idle" icon="circle" color="#gray">
**Gray indicator**: GPU is ready and waiting for requests. Fastest response time for new generations.
</Card>
<Card title="Running" icon="circle" color="#green">
**Green indicator**: GPU is actively processing your request. Generation in progress.
</Card>
<Card title="Cold Starting" icon="circle" color="#orange">
**Orange indicator**: GPU is warming up and loading models. First request after idle period.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

    alt="Playground header showing GPU status indicator with different operational states"
  />
</Frame>

{/* Image Description for Team: Screenshot of playground header showing GPU status indicator in different states with status text and workflow controls */}

### Performance Implications

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Idle State">
- **Response Time**: Immediate (< 1 second to start)
- **Best For**: Interactive testing and real-time workflows
- **Cost**: Active compute resources maintained
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cold Starting">
- **Response Time**: 30-120 seconds initial delay
- **Occurs When**: First request after period of inactivity
- **Best For**: Batch processing and non-time-sensitive tasks
- **Cost**: Lower cost as resources scale to zero when unused
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Running State">
- **Response Time**: Depends on workflow complexity
- **Queue Behavior**: Additional requests queue until completion
- **Best For**: Sequential generation tasks
- **Monitoring**: Progress indicators show generation status
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using the Playground

### Running Your Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure Inputs">
Fill in the required input fields on the left side:
- Enter text prompts, descriptions, or parameters
- Upload reference images if your workflow requires them
- Adjust numeric values and sliders to your preferences
</Step>
<Step title="Initiate Generation">
Click the **Generate** button at the bottom of the left column to start the workflow
</Step>
<Step title="Monitor Progress">
Watch the GPU status indicator and any progress bars that appear during generation
</Step>
<Step title="Review Results">
Generated outputs appear in the right column as they become available
</Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/playground/playground-usage-sequence.png"
    alt="Step-by-step sequence showing complete playground workflow from input to output"
  />
</Frame>

{/* Image Description for Team: Multi-panel sequence showing complete playground workflow from input configuration to results display */}

### Generation Process

<Frame>
<img
src="/images/deploy/generation-process.png"
alt="Playground showing generation in progress with status indicators"
/>
</Frame>

During generation, you'll see:

- **Progress indicators** showing workflow execution stages
- **GPU status updates** reflecting current processing state
- **Partial results** appearing as they're generated (for multi-step workflows)
- **Completion notifications** when generation finishes

<Note>
Generation time varies based on workflow complexity, model size, and current GPU state. Simple text workflows may complete in seconds, while high-resolution image generation can take several minutes.
</Note>

## Sharing and Collaboration

### Shareable Links

Every playground has a unique, shareable URL that enables team collaboration:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Team Access" icon="users">
**Share with colleagues** who need to test or use your workflow without ComfyUI knowledge
</Card>
<Card title="Client Demos" icon="presentation">
**Present to stakeholders** with a clean, professional interface that hides technical complexity
</Card>
<Card title="Creative Review" icon="eye">
**Enable creative teams** to experiment with parameters and generate variations
</Card>
<Card title="Quality Assurance" icon="check-circle">
**Facilitate testing** by non-technical team members for validation and feedback
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Sharing Best Practices

<Steps>
<Step title="Test Before Sharing">
Verify your playground works correctly with various input combinations
</Step>
<Step title="Document Expected Inputs">
Provide guidance on what inputs work best for your specific workflow
</Step>
<Step title="Set Appropriate Defaults">
Configure sensible default values so users can generate results immediately
</Step>
<Step title="Monitor Usage">
Track playground usage through your project's analytics dashboard
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Security Note**: Playground links provide access to your deployed workflow. Only share with trusted team members and consider implementing access controls for sensitive workflows.
</Warning>

## Integration with Development Workflow

### From Playground to Production

<Steps>
<Step title="Prototype in Playground">
Use the playground to validate workflow behavior and optimal parameters
</Step>
<Step title="Document Findings">
Record successful parameter combinations and expected outputs
</Step>
<Step title="Generate API Code">
Use the playground results to inform your API integration approach
</Step>
<Step title="Implement in Application">
Translate playground interactions into programmatic API calls using [SDKs](/deploy-api/sdk/sdk-python)
</Step>
</Steps>

### API Equivalent

Every playground interaction has a corresponding API call. Use the playground to:

- **Validate request formats** before writing API integration code
- **Test error conditions** and understand response structures  
- **Optimize parameters** for your specific use case
- **Generate example requests** for API documentation

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Playground to API
// Playground interaction
{
  "prompt": "A beautiful sunset over mountains",
  "steps": 25,
  "width": 1024,
  "height": 1024
}

// Equivalent API call
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/workflows/run', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    workflow_id: 'wf_abc123',
    inputs: {
      prompt: "A beautiful sunset over mountains",
      steps: 25,
      width: 1024,
      height: 1024
    }
  })
});
```
