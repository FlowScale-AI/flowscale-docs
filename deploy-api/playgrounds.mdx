Playground UIs provide an intuitive, web-based interface for testing and sharing your deployed workflows. Each configured and deployed workflow automatically generates its own playground, eliminating the need for users to navigate ComfyUI's complexity while still accessing the full power of your AI workflows.

<Info>
Playground UIs are automatically created alongside the API when you deploy a workflow. One playground is generated for each configured workflow in your project.

## Playground Interface

### Layout Overview

The playground features a clean, two-column design that makes testing workflows intuitive:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Left Column - Inputs">
**Input Controls**
- Parameter fields based on your workflow configuration
- Input types match your FlowScale I/O nodes (text fields, sliders, image uploads)
- Default values pre-filled from your workflow settings
- **Generate button** at the bottom to execute the workflow
</Tab>
<Tab title="Right Column - Outputs">
**Results Display**
- Output sections for each configured output node
- Real-time display of generated content (images, text, etc.)
- Download options for generated files
- Generation status and progress indicators
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Full playground interface showing two-column layout with input controls on left and output display on right]**

alt="Playground UI showing input and output columns"
/>
</Frame>

### Input Field Types

The input fields in your playground directly correspond to the FlowScale I/O nodes you configured:

| Input Node Type | Playground Control | Description |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **[FS] InputText** | Text area/field | Multi-line or single-line text input |
| **[FS] InputImage** | File upload | Drag-and-drop or click to upload images |
| **[FS] InputNumber** | Number input | Numeric field with validation |
| **[FS] InputSlider** | Range slider | Interactive slider with min/max values |

<Warning>
The available input fields are determined by your workflow's I/O configuration. If you need different inputs, return to the [workflow configuration](/deploy-api/configuration) to modify your setup.
</Warning>

## GPU Status Monitoring

### Understanding GPU States

The top-right corner of every playground displays real-time GPU status information:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Idle" icon="circle" color="#gray">
**Gray indicator**: GPU is ready and waiting for requests. Fastest response time for new generations.
</Card>
<Card title="Running" icon="circle" color="#green">
**Green indicator**: GPU is actively processing your request. Generation in progress.
</Card>
<Card title="Cold Starting" icon="circle" color="#orange">
**Orange indicator**: GPU is warming up and loading models. First request after idle period.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Close-up of playground header showing GPU status indicator in different states]**

### Performance Implications

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Idle State">
- **Response Time**: Immediate (< 1 second to start)
- **Best For**: Interactive testing and real-time workflows
- **Cost**: Active compute resources maintained
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cold Starting">
- **Response Time**: 30-120 seconds initial delay
- **Occurs When**: First request after period of inactivity
- **Best For**: Batch processing and non-time-sensitive tasks
- **Cost**: Lower cost as resources scale to zero when unused
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Running State">
- **Response Time**: Depends on workflow complexity
- **Queue Behavior**: Additional requests queue until completion
- **Best For**: Sequential generation tasks
- **Monitoring**: Progress indicators show generation status
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using the Playground

### Running Your Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure Inputs">
Fill in the required input fields on the left side:
- Enter text prompts, descriptions, or parameters
- Upload reference images if your workflow requires them
- Adjust numeric values and sliders to your preferences
</Step>
<Step title="Initiate Generation">
Click the **Generate** button at the bottom of the left column to start the workflow
</Step>
<Step title="Monitor Progress">
Watch the GPU status indicator and any progress bars that appear during generation
</Step>
<Step title="Review Results">
Generated outputs appear in the right column as they become available
</Step>
</Steps>

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Step-by-step sequence showing user filling inputs, clicking generate, and receiving outputs]**

### Generation Process

<Frame>
<img
src="/images/deploy/generation-process.png"
alt="Playground showing generation in progress with status indicators"
/>
</Frame>

During generation, you'll see:

- **Progress indicators** showing workflow execution stages
- **GPU status updates** reflecting current processing state
- **Partial results** appearing as they're generated (for multi-step workflows)
- **Completion notifications** when generation finishes

<Info>
Generation time varies based on workflow complexity, model size, and current GPU state. Simple text workflows may complete in seconds, while high-resolution image generation can take several minutes.
</Info>

## Sharing and Collaboration

### Shareable Links

Every playground has a unique, shareable URL that enables team collaboration:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Team Access" icon="users">
**Share with colleagues** who need to test or use your workflow without ComfyUI knowledge
</Card>
<Card title="Client Demos" icon="presentation">
**Present to stakeholders** with a clean, professional interface that hides technical complexity
</Card>
<Card title="Creative Review" icon="eye">
**Enable creative teams** to experiment with parameters and generate variations
</Card>
<Card title="Quality Assurance" icon="check-circle">
**Facilitate testing** by non-technical team members for validation and feedback
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Sharing Best Practices

<Steps>
<Step title="Test Before Sharing">
Verify your playground works correctly with various input combinations
</Step>
<Step title="Document Expected Inputs">
Provide guidance on what inputs work best for your specific workflow
</Step>
<Step title="Set Appropriate Defaults">
Configure sensible default values so users can generate results immediately
</Step>
<Step title="Monitor Usage">
Track playground usage through your project's analytics dashboard
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Security Note**: Playground links provide access to your deployed workflow. Only share with trusted team members and consider implementing access controls for sensitive workflows.
</Warning>

## Integration with Development Workflow

### From Playground to Production

<Steps>
<Step title="Prototype in Playground">
Use the playground to validate workflow behavior and optimal parameters
</Step>
<Step title="Document Findings">
Record successful parameter combinations and expected outputs
</Step>
<Step title="Generate API Code">
Use the playground results to inform your API integration approach
</Step>
<Step title="Implement in Application">
Translate playground interactions into programmatic API calls using [SDKs](/deploy-api/sdk/sdk-python)
</Step>
</Steps>

### API Equivalent

Every playground interaction has a corresponding API call. Use the playground to:

- **Validate request formats** before writing API integration code
- **Test error conditions** and understand response structures  
- **Optimize parameters** for your specific use case
- **Generate example requests** for API documentation

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Playground to API
// Playground interaction
{
  "prompt": "A beautiful sunset over mountains",
  "steps": 25,
  "width": 1024,
  "height": 1024
}

// Equivalent API call
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/workflows/run', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    workflow_id: 'wf_abc123',
    inputs: {
      prompt: "A beautiful sunset over mountains",
      steps: 25,
      width: 1024,
      height: 1024
    }
  })
});
```
