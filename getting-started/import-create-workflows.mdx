## Importing Existing Workflows

FlowScale makes it easy to import your existing ComfyUI workflows and run them on powerful cloud GPUs.

### From JSON Files

The most common way to import workflows is through ComfyUI's workflow JSON format:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export from ComfyUI">
    In ComfyUI, click **"Save"** to export your workflow as JSON
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import to FlowScale">
    In your FlowScale project, click **"Import Workflow"** and upload the JSON file
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolve Dependencies">
    FlowScale will automatically detect required models and custom nodes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test & Deploy">
    Run the workflow in the cloud editor and deploy when ready
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Supported Formats

| Format | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Workflow JSON** | Standard ComfyUI workflow format | Most common, includes all node connections and settings |
| **API JSON** | ComfyUI API format | Advanced users, programmatic workflows |
| **PNG with metadata** | Images with embedded workflow data | Workflows shared in communities |

<Tip>
When importing PNG files with embedded workflows, FlowScale automatically extracts the workflow data and converts it to the proper format.
</Tip>

## Creating New Workflows

Start building AI workflows from scratch using FlowScale's cloud-based ComfyUI editor.

### Quick Start Templates

FlowScale provides pre-built templates for common use cases:

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Template">
    Select a template or start with a blank canvas
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Nodes">
    Drag and drop nodes from the library to build your pipeline
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Nodes">
    Link node outputs to inputs to create the data flow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Parameters">
    Set up input parameters and default values
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test & Iterate">
    Run the workflow to validate functionality
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Models & Dependencies

FlowScale automatically handles model management and dependencies for your workflows.

### Automatic Model Detection

When you import a workflow, FlowScale:

- Scans for required models (checkpoints, LoRAs, VAEs)
- Checks availability in the public model library
- Prompts you to upload missing models

### Model Sources

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Public Library">
    Access thousands of pre-loaded models from:
    - Hugging Face
    - Civitai
    - Popular community models
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Private Models">
    Upload your own models:
    - Custom trained checkpoints
    - Fine-tuned LoRAs
    - Specialized VAEs
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Auto-Download">
    FlowScale can automatically download models from:
    - Direct URLs
    - Hugging Face repositories
    - Civitai links
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Custom Nodes

FlowScale supports most popular ComfyUI custom nodes:

- **ControlNet nodes**: Advanced image guidance
- **Face restoration**: Portrait enhancement workflows
- **Video processing**: Animation and video generation
- **3D workflows**: Depth maps and 3D scene generation

<Warning>
Some custom nodes may require manual installation. Contact support if you encounter compatibility issues with specific nodes.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design

- **Modular approach**: Break complex workflows into reusable components
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names for nodes and connections
- **Parameter exposure**: Make key settings accessible as API inputs
- **Error handling**: Add validation nodes for robust workflows

### Performance Optimization

- **Batch processing**: Group operations when possible
- **Memory management**: Use appropriate model precision settings
- **GPU selection**: Choose the right GPU tier for your workflow complexity

### Collaboration

- **Version control**: Commit changes with descriptive messages
- **Documentation**: Add comments explaining complex sections
- **Testing**: Validate workflows thoroughly before sharing
