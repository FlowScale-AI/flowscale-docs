FlowScale AI provides a centralized, team-friendly platform for managing ComfyUI workflows with deployment capabilities. Unlike ComfyUI's local interface, FlowScale AI is designed for collaboration and easy workflow deployment.

<Info>
Before working with workflows, you must first [create a project](/get-started/setup) in FlowScale AI. All workflows are organized within projects.
</Info>

## Understanding FlowScale AI vs ComfyUI

FlowScale AI's interface differs from standard ComfyUI because it's built for:
- **Team collaboration**: Centralized workspace for multiple users
- **Deployment focus**: Easy conversion of workflows to APIs
- **Cloud infrastructure**: Scalable compute resources on demand

While ComfyUI's default interface is designed for local, isolated workflow development, FlowScale AI extends this with enterprise features and cloud deployment capabilities.

## Importing Existing Workflows

Import your existing ComfyUI workflows to run them on powerful cloud GPUs with team collaboration features.

### Step-by-Step Import Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Import Workflow">
    In your FlowScale AI project dashboard, click the **"Import Workflow"** button
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Project dashboard with Import Workflow button highlighted]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Upload Workflow JSON">
    Select and upload your ComfyUI workflow JSON file (exported from ComfyUI using the "Save" option)
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Import modal showing file upload area]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Custom Nodes">
    FlowScale AI automatically detects required custom nodes and displays them for review
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Custom nodes detection screen showing detected nodes]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resolve Conflicts">
    If conflicting nodes are detected, select the correct versions that your workflow actually uses
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Node conflict resolution interface]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    Click proceed to add all necessary configuration for your workflow
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Supported Import Format

FlowScale AI currently supports importing **Workflow JSON** files only - the standard ComfyUI workflow format exported via ComfyUI's "Save" button. This ensures maximum compatibility and reliability when importing your workflows.

## Starting ComfyUI Editor

FlowScale AI uses **Pods** to run ComfyUI instances in the cloud.

### Launch Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start ComfyUI">
    Click **"Start ComfyUI"** button in your project
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Project interface with Start ComfyUI button]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Pod">
    Choose the pod configuration for your ComfyUI instance from the modal
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Pod selection modal with different pod options]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Installation">
    While ComfyUI starts, custom nodes are installed automatically. View progress in System Logs
    
    *[Screenshot needed: ComfyUI starting screen with logs panel open showing installation progress]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Editor Ready">
    Once started, you'll see the ComfyUI editor in CPU mode
    
    *[Screenshot needed: ComfyUI editor interface with CPU mode indicator]*
  </Step>
</Steps>

### CPU vs GPU Mode

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CPU Mode (Default)">
    - **Purpose**: Workflow editing and development
    - **Cost**: Minimal credits usage
    - **Best for**: Building, testing, and modifying workflows
    - **Switch to**: Use the actions bar at the bottom of the page
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="GPU Mode">
    - **Purpose**: Running compute-intensive workflows
    - **Cost**: Higher credits usage
    - **Best for**: Actual workflow execution and testing
    - **Switch from**: Actions bar when you need to execute workflows
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
**Cost Optimization**: Always use CPU mode for editing workflows and only switch to GPU mode when you need to execute them. This prevents unnecessary credit burn.
</Tip>

## Managing Models and Dependencies

Model management in FlowScale AI is a manual process that ensures you have full control over your dependencies.

### Model Setup Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start ComfyUI Editor">
    Launch your ComfyUI instance in your project
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Workflow">
    Run your workflow once to identify missing models (you'll see error messages)
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Error message showing missing model]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Workflow Node Dropdowns for Public Models">
    Look for required models in the dropdown menus of the workflow nodes themselves. If models are available in the public library, they will appear in the relevant node dropdowns within your workflow
    
    <Tip>
    Models may appear under similar filenamesâ€”check carefully for variations or similar names.
    </Tip>
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Workflow node showing model dropdown with available models]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Private Models">
    If models aren't found publicly, navigate to **Private Models** section
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Private models interface]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Model Folders">
    Create appropriate folder structure as required by ComfyUI or custom nodes
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Creating model folder interface]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Upload Models">
    Click **"Upload Model"** and either search for models or provide download links
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Model upload interface with search and URL options]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Refresh ComfyUI">
    After model download completes, refresh ComfyUI from the actions bar
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Refresh button in actions bar]*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Model Availability">
    Check the workflow node dropdowns again to confirm the newly added models are now available for selection
    
    *[Screenshot needed: Workflow node dropdown showing newly added model]*
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Model Sources

    Custom models, fine-tuned checkpoints, and specialized LoRAs
  </Card>
  <Card title="URL Download" icon="link">
    Direct download from external sources using model URLs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Folder Structure Guidelines

When creating folders for models, follow ComfyUI conventions:

- **Checkpoints**: `models/checkpoints/`
- **LoRAs**: `models/loras/`
- **VAE**: `models/vae/`
- **Custom nodes**: Check the node's GitHub repository for specific folder requirements

<Warning>
For custom node models, always refer to the node's GitHub repository README for correct folder naming conventions.
</Warning>
