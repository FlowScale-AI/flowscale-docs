Import your ComfyUI workflows into FlowScale AI for team collaboration and production deployment. This guide covers importing existing workflows and creating new ones in the cloud environment.

<Note>
**New to FlowScale AI?** You'll need to [create a project first](/getting-started/glossary/projects). Think of projects as collaborative workspaces where your team's workflows live and evolve together.

### Supported Import Format

FlowScale AI imports **Workflow JSON** files from ComfyUI's "Save" function.

<Warning>
**File Format Matters:** Only use JSON files exported directly from ComfyUI's Save function. Other export formats or manually edited files may cause import issues or lost functionality.
</Warning>

## Accessing ComfyUI Workspace

Pods are cloud-hosted ComfyUI instances that provide on-demand access to GPU resources.

</Frame>

{/* Image Description for Team: Screenshot of ComfyUI workspace showing full interface with CPU mode indicator and imported workflow */}
  </Step>
</Steps>

### CPU vs GPU Mode

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CPU Mode (Default)">
    **For workflow editing:**
    - Connecting nodes and adjusting parameters
    - Low cost for workflow development
    - Use for planning and structure building
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="GPU Mode">
    **For workflow execution:**
    - Running inference and testing outputs
    - Higher cost but enterprise GPU performance
    - Use only when generating results
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
**Cost Optimization**: Always use CPU mode for editing workflows and only switch to GPU mode when you need to execute them. This prevents unnecessary credit burn.
</Tip>

## Model Management

FlowScale AI provides centralized model management with public and private model libraries for team sharing.

### Model Setup Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start ComfyUI Workspace">
    Launch your ComfyUI instance in your project
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Workflow">
    Run your workflow once to identify missing models (you'll see error messages)
    
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/glossary/comfyui_missing_nodes.png" alt="Error modal showing missing model notification with specific model names, suggested resolution actions, and links to model management tools. Clear error messaging with actionable next steps" />
</Frame>

{/* Image Description for Team: Screenshot of error message showing missing model notification with resolution options and action buttons */}
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Workflow Node Dropdowns for Public Models">
    Look for required models in the dropdown menus of the workflow nodes themselves. If models are available in the public library, they will appear in the relevant node dropdowns within your workflow
    
    <Tip>
    Models may appear under similar filenamesâ€”check carefully for variations or similar names.
    </Tip>

### Model Sources

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Public Library" icon="globe">
    Pre-loaded models from Hugging Face, Civitai, and popular community sources

  </Card>
  <Card title="URL Download" icon="link">
    Direct download from external sources using model URLs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Folder Structure Guidelines

When creating folders for models, follow ComfyUI conventions:

- **Checkpoints**: `models/checkpoints/`
- **LoRAs**: `models/loras/`
- **VAE**: `models/vae/`
- **Custom nodes**: Check the node's GitHub repository for specific folder requirements

<Warning>
For custom node models, always refer to the node's GitHub repository README for correct folder naming conventions.
</Warning>
