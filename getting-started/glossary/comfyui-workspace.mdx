## What is the ComfyUI Workspace?

When you open a project in FlowScale AI, you enter the **ComfyUI Workspace** â€” your complete environment for building, testing, and managing generative AI workflows. Think of it as your personal AI laboratory where the familiar ComfyUI interface meets enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure.

</Frame>

The workspace seamlessly bridges the gap between creative experimentation and production deployment. You start with an idea, build it using ComfyUI's visual workflow editor, test it with your team's shared resources, and then deploy it to production â€” all within a single, integrated environment.

## Understanding Your Workspace

Your workspace is thoughtfully organized into three key areas, each serving a specific purpose in your workflow development journey:

**Left Panel: Your Project Hub**
This is where you manage everything related to your project. The **Workflows tab** helps you organize your creations, the **Models tab** gives you access to your organization's AI model library, and the **Nodes tab** manages the custom functionality your workflows depend on.

**Right Panel: Your Creative Canvas**
Here's where the magic happens. After clicking **"Start ComfyUI"**, this area transforms into the full ComfyUI interface where you'll design and test your AI workflows.

**Bottom Panel: Your Control Center**
Think of this as your mission control â€” buttons to save your work, toggle between CPU and GPU modes, run your workflows, and monitor everything through the logs.

## Your First Steps: Starting ComfyUI

Getting your creative environment up and running is straightforward. Here's how your journey begins:

### The Launch Sequence

1. **Click "Start ComfyUI"** in the right panel â€” this is your gateway to the creative process
2. **Choose your computing power** by selecting a Pod from the dialog
3. **Watch the magic happen** as the system prepares your environment (you'll see "ComfyUI resources are being prepared")
4. **Enter your creative space** as ComfyUI loads with a default workflow ready for your modifications

<Frame>

</Frame>

Once ComfyUI springs to life, you're greeted with a pre-loaded workflow that serves as your starting point. The full ComfyUI interface is now at your fingertips, enhanced with FlowScale's collaborative features and cloud infrastructure.

## Mastering Your Control Center

Now that ComfyUI is running, let's explore the control bar at the bottom â€” your command center for managing workflows efficiently and cost-effectively.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/glossary/comfyui-control-center.png" alt="Detailed view of ComfyUI control bar showing all available actions, tools, and workspace controls with clear iconography and organization" />
</Frame>

Each button serves a specific purpose in your creative workflow:

### Save Button (ðŸ’¾) â€” Preserve Your Progress
Never lose your work. Click this after making changes to ensure your workflow modifications are safely stored in your project.

### CPU/GPU Toggle â€” Smart Resource Management
Here's where FlowScale's cost-effectiveness shines. Start in **CPU mode** ($0.14/hour) for workflow building and editing, then switch to **GPU mode** only when you need to run actual generations. This approach can save your organization significant costs while maintaining full functionality.

### Queue Button (White) â€” Bring Your Vision to Life
Ready to see your workflow in action? This button executes your current workflow, processing it through the entire pipeline with your specified inputs.

### Stop Button (Red Square) â€” Emergency Brake
Sometimes you need to halt a runaway process. This immediately stops any currently running generation, giving you back control.

### Refresh Button (ðŸ”„) â€” Reset and Reload
After installing new custom nodes or uploading models, refresh ComfyUI to make these new resources available in your workspace.

### Power Button (Red Circle) â€” Clean Exit
When you're done working, this properly shuts down your ComfyUI session and frees up computing resources. You'll need to restart ComfyUI when you're ready to work again.

## Building Your Workflow Library

The **Workflows tab** is where your AI creations come to life and get organized. Whether you're starting from scratch or bringing existing workflows into FlowScale, this is your creative command center.

### Starting Fresh: Creating New Workflows

**Organize with Purpose**
Click the **plus icon** to create folders that make sense for your team â€” organize by project type, client, or development stage. A well-structured workspace saves time and reduces confusion as your library grows.

**Begin Creating**
The **"Create New Workflow"** button loads a default ComfyUI template, giving you a clean slate to build upon. It's like having a prepared canvas waiting for your artistic vision.

### Bringing Existing Work: Import Workflows

Already have workflows you've built elsewhere? The import process is designed to be seamless:

#### Step 1: Upload Your Creation
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/glossary/comfyui-import-workflow.png" alt="Workflow import dialog showing file selection, validation, and import configuration options with user guidance" />
</Frame>

Simply drag and drop your workflow JSON file (use the standard ComfyUI workflow format, not the API version), give it a descriptive name, and choose where to store it.

#### Step 2: Resolve Dependencies Intelligently
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/glossary/comfyui-nodes-manager.png " alt="Dependencies management interface showing required custom nodes, models, and configuration requirements for imported workflows" />
</Frame>

FlowScale automatically analyzes your workflow and presents three categories:

- **Custom Nodes**: Automatically detected and pre-selected
- **Conflicting Nodes**: When multiple repositories have similar names, choose the right one
- **Missing Nodes**: Provide GitHub URLs for nodes that couldn't be found automatically

The system handles the complex dependency resolution, so you can focus on creating rather than troubleshooting.

### Managing Your Growing Library

As your workflow collection expands, the three-dot menu on each item gives you essential management options: rename for clarity, download for backup, or delete when no longer needed. The visual indicators (red cross or green checkmark) instantly show you which workflows are ready for API deployment.

## Accessing Your AI Arsenal: Models and Custom Nodes

### Models Tab: Your Organization's AI Library

The **Models tab** brings your organization's entire AI model collection directly into your workspace. It's the same powerful interface you'd find in the global Models section, but conveniently located where you're actively building workflows.

This means while you're deep in creative flow, you can quickly browse, add, or manage the AI models your workflows depend on â€” without leaving your workspace. For detailed model management guidance, see our [Models documentation](/getting-started/glossary/models).

### Nodes Tab: Extending Your Capabilities

Think of custom nodes as specialized tools that expand what your workflows can accomplish. The **Nodes tab** manages these extensions, ensuring your workflows have all the functionality they need.

#### Automatic Management
When you import workflows, any required custom nodes appear here automatically. You can see what's installed, what's needed, and the status of each dependency at a glance.

#### Adding New Capabilities Manually

Sometimes you'll want to add custom nodes for future projects or specific functionality:

1. **Click the plus button** and select "Add Custom Node"
2. **Search by name** for popular nodes, or provide a **GitHub repository URL** for specific ones
3. **Configure advanced settings** if needed:

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/glossary/comfyui-custom-nodes.png" alt="Interface for adding custom nodes showing node search, installation options, and dependency management tools" />
</Frame>

The advanced settings let you specify Python dependencies, Linux packages, or pin to specific GitHub commits for production stability. Most of the time, the basic settings are sufficient, but these options give you fine-grained control when needed.

## Working Smart: Best Practices for Success

As you become more comfortable with the ComfyUI Workspace, these practices will help you work more efficiently and avoid common pitfalls:

### Resource Management That Saves Money
- **Start in CPU mode** for all your workflow building and editing work
- **Switch to GPU** only when you need to run actual generations  
- **Stop ComfyUI sessions** when you step away â€” this frees up resources and keeps costs down

### Organization That Scales
- **Create descriptive folder names** that your future self (and teammates) will understand
- **Use clear workflow names** that indicate their purpose or use case
- **Save your work regularly** â€” make it a habit after any significant changes

### Dependency Management That Prevents Headaches
- **Import all required custom nodes** during the workflow import process
- **Test workflows immediately** after importing to catch dependency issues early
- **Document special requirements** so team members know what's needed
