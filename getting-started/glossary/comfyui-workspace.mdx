## What is the ComfyUI Workspace?

The ComfyUI Workspace is the main interface you see when you open a project in FlowScale AI. This is your central hub for building and managing generative AI workflows using the familiar ComfyUI interface, enhanced with FlowScale's cloud infrastructure and collaboration features.

</Frame>

### Save Button (ðŸ’¾)
- **Purpose**: Save changes to your current workflow
- **When to use**: After making modifications to your workflow
- **Result**: Updates are saved to your project

### CPU/GPU Toggle Switch
- **Default mode**: CPU ($0.07/hour) - Low cost for workflow editing
- **GPU mode**: Switch when you need to run actual generations
- **Cost-effective**: Use CPU for building, GPU only for execution

### Queue Button (White)
- **Purpose**: Run your workflow (queue a generation)
- **Function**: Executes the current workflow with your inputs
- **Result**: Processes through the workflow pipeline

### Stop Button (Red Square)
- **Purpose**: Stop a currently running generation
- **When to use**: Cancel long-running or problematic executions
- **Effect**: Halts workflow execution immediately

### Refresh Button (ðŸ”„)
- **Purpose**: Refresh the ComfyUI instance
- **When to use**: After installing custom nodes or uploading models
- **Effect**: Reloads ComfyUI to recognize new resources

### Power Button (Red Circle)
- **Purpose**: Stop the entire ComfyUI session
- **Effect**: Shuts down ComfyUI and frees up pod resources
- **Note**: You'll need to restart ComfyUI to continue working

## Workflows Tab

The Workflows tab is your central hub for organizing and managing all your AI workflows.

### Creating New Content

**Create Folder:**
- Click the **plus icon** to create a new folder
- Organize workflows by project, type, or team
- Helps maintain clean project structure

**Create New Workflow:**
- Click **"Create New Workflow"** button
- Loads the default ComfyUI workflow template
- Ready for immediate customization

**Import Workflow:**
- Click **"Import Workflow"** from the dropdown
- Upload existing ComfyUI workflows to your project

</Frame>

### Managing Existing Workflows

**Workflow Actions (Three-dot menu):**
- **Rename** - Change workflow or folder names
- **Download** - Export workflow as JSON file
- **Delete** - Remove workflows or folders

**API Deployment Status:**
- **Red cross icon** - Workflow not configured for API deployment
- **Green checkmark** - Workflow ready for API deployment

### Import Workflow Process

#### Step 1: Upload Workflow File
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/build/import-workflow-modal.png" alt="Import workflow dialog showing drag and drop area for JSON files" />
</Frame>

1. **Drag and drop** your workflow JSON file
   - Use the **workflow JSON** file (not the API JSON file)
   - Standard ComfyUI workflow format
2. **Provide workflow name** for easy identification
3. **Select target folder** or create a new one
4. Click **"Next"** to proceed

#### Step 2: Configure Dependencies
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/build/workflow-dependencies.png" alt="Dependency configuration screen showing custom nodes, conflicting nodes, and missing nodes sections" />
</Frame>

The system automatically identifies required custom nodes and presents three categories:

**Custom Nodes:**
- Automatically detected custom nodes from your workflow
- Pre-selected based on workflow requirements

**Conflicting Nodes:**
- Nodes with similar names from different repositories
- **Choose the correct repository** for your workflow
- When in doubt, select all and refine later

**Missing Nodes:**
- Nodes that couldn't be found automatically
- **Provide GitHub repository URLs** for these nodes
- Required for workflow to function properly

**Finalize Import:**
- Review your selections
- Click **"Confirm"** to complete the import
- Custom nodes will be installed automatically

## Models Tab

The Models tab provides access to your organization's complete model library directly within your project workspace.

### Functionality
- **Same interface** as the global Models section
- **Organization-wide access** - All models available across projects
- **Convenient location** - Manage models while working on workflows

For complete model management instructions, refer to the [Models documentation](/getting-started/glossary/models).

## Nodes Tab

The Nodes tab manages custom nodes required for your workflows to function properly.

### Viewing Installed Nodes
- **Imported workflow nodes** appear automatically after workflow import
- **Required dependencies** are listed for each workflow
- **Installation status** shows which nodes are ready

### Adding Custom Nodes

#### Manual Addition Process
1. **Click the plus button** in the Nodes tab
2. **Select "Add Custom Node"** from the dropdown
3. **Configure the custom node** in the dialog

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/build/add-custom-node-dialog.png" alt="Add custom node dialog showing search field, GitHub URL input, and advanced settings" />
</Frame>

#### Configuration Options

**Basic Settings:**
- **Search by name** - Find popular custom nodes by name
- **GitHub repository URL** - Direct link to the custom node repository

**Advanced Settings (Optional):**
- **Python dependencies** - Comma-separated list of required Python packages
- **Linux dependencies** - Comma-separated list of system packages
- **GitHub SHA** - Pin to specific commit for version stability

#### When to Use Advanced Settings
- **Python dependencies**: When nodes need additional Python libraries
- **Linux dependencies**: When nodes require system-level packages
- **GitHub SHA**: For production stability or specific version requirements

**Complete Installation:**
- Review your configuration
- Click **"Save"** to install the custom node
- Node becomes available in your ComfyUI workspace

## Best Practices

### Resource Management
- **Use CPU mode** for workflow building and editing
- **Switch to GPU** only when running actual generations
- **Stop ComfyUI** when not actively working to save costs

### Workflow Organization
- **Create descriptive folder structures** for easy navigation
- **Use clear workflow names** that indicate their purpose
- **Regularly save your work** using the save button

### Dependency Management
- **Import all required custom nodes** during workflow import
- **Test workflows** after importing to ensure all dependencies work
- **Document custom requirements** for team collaboration

## Troubleshooting

### ComfyUI Won't Start
- **Check pod availability** - Ensure pods are running in your organization
- **Verify permissions** - Confirm you have access to the selected pod
- **Try different pod** - Some pods may be temporarily unavailable

### Workflow Execution Issues
- **Refresh ComfyUI** after installing new nodes or models
- **Check logs** at the bottom panel for error details
- **Verify all inputs** are properly connected in your workflow

### Custom Node Problems
- **Check dependencies** - Ensure all Python/Linux packages are specified
- **Verify GitHub URLs** - Confirm repository links are correct and accessible
- **Restart ComfyUI** after installing new custom nodes
