## What are Models in FlowScale?

Models in FlowScale AI are the core AI engines that power your generative workflows. These are pre-trained machine learning models that can generate images, process text, transform data, and perform various AI tasks. FlowScale provides a comprehensive model management system that handles everything from model discovery to deployment optimization.
