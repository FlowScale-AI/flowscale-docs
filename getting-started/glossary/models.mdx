## What are Models in FlowScale?

Models in FlowScale AI are the powerful AI engines that drive your generative workflows. Just like in a local ComfyUI setup, these models need to be properly organized and accessible for your workflows to function. FlowScale simplifies this process by providing both a curated collection of public models and the ability to manage your own private model library.

For a deeper understanding of how models work in ComfyUI, refer to the [official ComfyUI documentation on models](https://docs.comfy.org/development/core-concepts/models).

## Model Storage and Organization

### Dedicated Model Storage
FlowScale provides each organization with a **dedicated volume** for model storage with:
- **Unlimited storage capacity** - No restrictions on model library size
- **Organization-level access** - All team members can access shared models
- **Persistent storage** - Models remain available across all projects and sessions

### ComfyUI-Compatible Folder Structure
FlowScale maintains the exact same folder structure as local ComfyUI installations, ensuring seamless compatibility:

```
Models/
├── checkpoints/          # Stable Diffusion checkpoints
├── vae/                 # VAE models
├── loras/               # LoRA models
├── controlnet/          # ControlNet models
├── clip/                # CLIP models
├── unet/                # U-Net models
├── upscale_models/      # Super-resolution models
└── embeddings/          # Text embeddings
```

This structure ensures that models are automatically recognized by ComfyUI workflows without any additional configuration.

## Accessing the Models Interface

You can access the same models interface from two convenient locations in FlowScale:

### 1. Global Models Tab
- Located next to the **Pods** tab in the main navigation
- Provides organization-wide model management
- Access all models available to your organization

### 2. Project-Level Models Section
- Available within each individual project for convenience
- Shows the same organization-wide models as the global tab
- Convenient access while working within a project context
- No difference in functionality - just easier access during workflow development

The public library is continuously updated by the FlowScale team to include the latest and most effective models in the AI community.

## Managing Private Models

### When to Use Private Models
Use the **Private Models** section when:
- The model you need isn't available in the public library
- You have custom-trained or fine-tuned models
- You need proprietary models for your organization
- You want to use specific model versions not in the public collection

### Creating Folder Structure

Before uploading a model, ensure the correct folder exists:

1. **Check existing folders** - See if the appropriate category folder exists
2. **Create new folder** - If needed, create the folder matching ComfyUI conventions
3. **Follow naming conventions** - Use standard ComfyUI folder names for compatibility

</Frame>

#### 2. Choose Your Upload Method
The upload dialog provides three options:

**Option A: Direct URL Download**
- Paste the direct download URL of the model
- FlowScale will download the model directly to your storage
- Fastest method for publicly available models

**Option B: Local File Upload**
- Upload model files from your computer
- Drag and drop or browse to select files
- Best for custom models or files you already have locally

**Option C: Search and Import**
- Search by model name to find models from:
  - **Civitai.com** - Community-created models and LoRAs
  - **Hugging Face** - Research and open-source models
- Browse search results and select the model you want

</Frame>

#### 3. Configure API Access (if needed)

For models from external platforms, you'll need API credentials:

**For Civitai Models:**
- Get your API key from [Civitai API Settings](https://civitai.com/user/account)
- Paste the API key in the upload dialog
- Required for downloading from Civitai's repository

**For Hugging Face Models:**
- Get your access token from [Hugging Face Token Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
- Paste the token in the upload dialog

## Using Uploaded Models in ComfyUI

### Accessing Models in Workflows

After uploading models to FlowScale:

1. **Open your ComfyUI workspace** in any project
2. **Add model nodes** to your workflow (Load Checkpoint, Load LoRA, etc.)
3. **Click the model dropdown** in the node
4. **Select your uploaded model** from the list

### Refreshing Model List

If newly uploaded models don't appear in ComfyUI:

#### Method 1: Refresh Button
- Look for the **Refresh** button in the **Actions Bar** at the bottom of ComfyUI
- Click to reload the model list
- This updates ComfyUI's model cache with newly uploaded models

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/glossary/comfyui-restart-models.png" alt="Workspace refresh interface showing model synchronization and workspace update controls" />
</Frame>

#### Method 2: Restart ComfyUI
If refresh doesn't work:
1. **Stop ComfyUI** using the stop button
2. **Start ComfyUI** again
3. Models should now be visible in dropdowns

This fully reloads ComfyUI and ensures all models are properly detected.

## Troubleshooting Model Issues

### Model Not Visible in ComfyUI

**Problem:** Uploaded model doesn't appear in node dropdowns in ComfyUI

**Solutions:**
1. **Check folder placement** - Ensure model is in the correct ComfyUI folder
2. **Verify folder spelling** - Check that folder names match ComfyUI's exact spelling requirements (e.g., `checkpoints/`, `loras/`, `controlnet/`)
3. **Refresh ComfyUI** - Use the refresh button in the actions bar
4. **Restart ComfyUI** - Stop and start ComfyUI to force reload
5. **Verify upload completion** - Check that upload finished successfully
6. **Check file format** - Ensure model file has correct extension (.safetensors, .ckpt, etc.)

### Upload Failures

**Problem:** Model upload fails or gets stuck

**Solutions:**
1. **Check internet connection** - Ensure stable connection for large downloads
2. **Verify API keys** - Ensure Civitai/Hugging Face credentials are correct
3. **Try different upload method** - Switch between URL, local upload, or search
