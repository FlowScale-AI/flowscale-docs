## What are Pods?

**Pods** in FlowScale AI are isolated compute environments that execute your ComfyUI workflows. Think of them as virtual machines specifically optimized for AI workloads, equipped with powerful GPUs and pre-configured with all necessary dependencies.

## Pod Lifecycle

### Provisioning

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request">
    User initiates workflow execution or deployment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scheduling">
    FlowScale AI selects optimal pod type and availability zone
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialization">
    Pod starts up and loads required models and dependencies
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ready">
    Pod is ready to execute workflows
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Execution

During workflow execution:

1. **Input processing**: Receive and validate input data
2. **Workflow execution**: Run ComfyUI workflow steps
3. **Output generation**: Process and format results
4. **Cleanup**: Free resources and prepare for next request

### Termination

Pods are terminated when:

- Workflow execution completes
- Idle timeout is reached
- Manual termination by user
- Pod replacement due to updates or maintenance

## Pod Management

### Automatic Scaling

FlowScale AI automatically manages pod scaling based on demand:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scale-Up Triggers">
    - Incoming API requests exceed current capacity
    - Queue length reaches configured thresholds
    - Response time targets are not being met
    - Scheduled batch jobs require additional resources
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scale-Down Triggers">
    - Request volume decreases below capacity
    - Pods remain idle beyond configured timeout
    - Cost optimization algorithms identify opportunities
    - Maintenance windows require pod cycling
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scaling Policies">
    - Minimum and maximum pod counts
    - Scale-up and scale-down rates
    - Cooldown periods to prevent thrashing
    - Geographic distribution preferences
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Pod Health Monitoring

FlowScale AI continuously monitors pod health:

- **Resource utilization**: CPU, GPU, memory, and storage usage
- **Performance metrics**: Execution times, throughput, error rates
- **Health checks**: Automated tests to verify pod functionality
- **Alerting**: Notifications for performance issues or failures

## Development vs Production Pods

### Development Pods

**Characteristics**:
- Longer session persistence (up to 6 hours)
- Full ComfyUI editor interface
- Real-time collaboration features
- Debugging and development tools
- Flexible resource allocation

**Use Cases**:
