## What is a Project?

A **project** in FlowScale is a workspace that contains your workflows and all the configurations needed to run them. You must create a project before you can start building or importing any workflows.

Once you've built your workflows, you can deploy them from your project as APIs or Playground UIs on a Pod.

## Project Components

Every FlowScale project includes:

## ComfyUI Workspace

The ComfyUI Workspace is where you build and modify your AI workflows. It provides a visual node-based interface for creating complex AI pipelines.

<Info>
Learn more about ComfyUI in the [ComfyUI documentation](/getting-started/glossary/comfyui).

## Deployments

Once your workflows are ready, you can deploy them as:

- **APIs**: RESTful endpoints for programmatic access
- **Playground UIs**: Interactive web interfaces for testing

</Frame>

All deployed workflows run on Pods, which provide the computational resources needed for your AI workflows.

## Runs

The Runs section shows the execution history of your workflows, including:

- Runs triggered through deployed APIs
- Runs executed in the Playground UI
- Input parameters and output results
- Execution timestamps and status

## Project Settings

### API Keys

Once you deploy an API, you can manage API keys in the project settings. These keys are used to authenticate requests to your deployed workflows.

### Environment Variables

If your workflows or custom nodes require specific environment variables, you can configure them in the Environment Settings. This is useful for:

- API keys for external services
- Configuration parameters
- Custom node requirements

### Collaborators

You can add team members to your project for collaboration.

<Note>
Before adding collaborators to a project, they must first be added to your organization.
