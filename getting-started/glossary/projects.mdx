## What are Projects?

A **project** in FlowScale is a workspace that contains related workflows, models, and configurations. Projects serve as the organizational unit for your AI development work, enabling team collaboration, resource sharing, and deployment management.

## Project Types

### Personal Projects

**Individual workspaces** for personal AI development:

- **Private by default**: Only accessible to the creator
- **Full control**: Complete ownership of all resources
- **No usage limits**: Subject only to account limits
- **Easy sharing**: Can invite collaborators when needed

### Team Projects

**Collaborative workspaces** for team development:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Small Teams (2-5 members)">
    - Shared workflow development
    - Informal collaboration patterns
    - Simple permission management
    - Direct communication within the platform
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Large Teams (5+ members)">
    - Role-based access control
    - Structured workflow approval processes
    - Integration with external tools (GitHub, Slack)
    - Advanced monitoring and analytics
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Organization Projects

**Enterprise-level** project management:

- **Centralized governance**: Organization-wide policies and standards
- **Resource pooling**: Shared GPU quotas and model libraries
- **Compliance features**: Audit trails and security controls
- **Billing management**: Unified billing across all projects

## Project Lifecycle

### Creation and Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Project">
    Choose project name, description, and initial settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Resources">
    Set GPU preferences and resource limits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Team Members">
    Invite collaborators with appropriate permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Initial Workflows">
    Upload existing workflows or start with templates
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Development Phase

During active development, projects evolve through:

- **Workflow creation**: Building new AI pipelines
- **Model management**: Adding and organizing AI models
- **Testing and iteration**: Refining workflows through experimentation
- **Version control**: Tracking changes and maintaining history

### Production Phase

Mature projects focus on:

- **Deployment management**: Maintaining live APIs and applications
- **Performance optimization**: Monitoring and improving efficiency
- **Scaling operations**: Handling increased usage and demand
- **Maintenance**: Updates, bug fixes, and security patches

## Collaboration Features

### Team Management
