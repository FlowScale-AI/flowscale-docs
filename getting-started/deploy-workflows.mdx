**This is the moment everything changes.** You've built something amazing in ComfyUI, refined it in the FlowScale AI workspace, and now you're ready to transform it from a personal creative tool into **a production service that others can actually use and depend on**.

Deployment isn't just about making your workflow accessible—it's about crossing the bridge from "I made something cool" to "I built something valuable that solves real problems for real people."

<Note>
**What you're about to accomplish:** Your workflow will become a governed, scalable API with automatic documentation, interactive interfaces, and enterprise-grade reliability. In minutes, not months.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Haven't set up your workflow yet?** You'll need to complete the [Import/Create Workflows guide](/getting-started/import-create-workflows) first. The deployment process requires a fully configured, tested workflow as its foundation.
</Warning>

## Preparing for Production: Ensuring Reliability

**Think of this as your final quality check before going live.** These prerequisites ensure that when your workflow becomes a production API, it performs consistently and reliably for every user.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Successful Execution">
    **Run your workflow at least once successfully** in the ComfyUI workspace
    <br /> <br />
    *Why this matters:* This proves your workflow can complete its full process without errors, giving you and your users confidence in its reliability.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Workflow">
    **Save the workflow** after successful execution
    <br /> <br />
    *Why this matters:* This creates a stable version that can be consistently reproduced, preventing "works on my machine" issues in production.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Dependencies">
    **Confirm all models and custom nodes** are properly set up
    <br /> <br />
    *Why this matters:* Dependencies that work in development need to be available in production. This step prevents runtime failures when users start making API calls.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

{/* Image Description for Team: Screenshot of ComfyUI workspace after successful execution showing nodes with green checkmarks and completion status */}

<Warning>
**Important**: The workflow must run successfully at least once in the ComfyUI workspace before deployment. This ensures all models and custom nodes are properly configured and the platform can verify the workflow's functionality.
</Warning>

## Defining Your API Interface: From Internal Logic to External Service

**Here's where your creative workflow becomes a professional API.** Right now, your workflow is perfectly designed for ComfyUI—but APIs need clear, standardized interfaces that developers and applications can rely on.

This configuration step transforms your internal node connections into **a clean, documented API contract** that:

- **Creates intuitive parameters** that make sense to your users (not just ComfyUI experts)
- **Generates automatic documentation** that developers can understand and integrate with
- **Builds interactive interfaces** that non-technical users can navigate confidently
- **Establishes reliable contracts** that won't break when you update your internal workflow logic

<Note>
By default, workflows are not configured for deployment. You'll notice a **red cross mark** next to unconfigured workflows in your project's workflow sidebar.
</Note>

</Frame>

{/* Image Description for Team: Screenshot of FlowScale project sidebar showing workflow list with red cross icons indicating unconfigured deployment status */}

### The Interface Design Challenge

**Your workflow is complex and powerful—your API interface should be simple and intuitive.** This is the art of good API design: hiding complexity while preserving capability.

FlowScale AI needs to understand:
- **Which inputs should be user-controllable** vs. which should remain internal constants
- **How outputs should be formatted** for different types of consumers (web apps, mobile apps, automation systems)
- **What level of control to expose** without overwhelming users or compromising your creative vision

### Configuration Methods

There are two primary ways to configure a workflow for deployment:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="FlowScale I/O Nodes (Recommended)">
    Use specialized FlowScale I/O nodes that are designed for deployment configuration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced I/O Configurator">
    Use the advanced configuration interface for complex setups. [Read more about advanced API configuration](/deploy-api/overview).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using FlowScale I/O Nodes: The Bridge to Production APIs

**This is where ComfyUI nodes become API endpoints.** FlowScale I/O nodes are specially designed to translate between your creative workflow logic and the standardized interfaces that production applications expect.

<Tip>
**Design philosophy:** Instead of exposing every ComfyUI parameter as an API input, thoughtfully choose which controls your users actually need. Great APIs are simple to use but powerful in capability.
</Tip>

### Adding Input Nodes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Node Search">
    Double-click on an empty area in the ComfyUI workspace to open the node search
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for Input Nodes">
    Type one of the following input node names:
    - **InputText** - For text prompts and string inputs
    - **InputImage** - For image uploads
    - **InputNumber** - For numeric parameters
    - **InputSlider** - For slider controls
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select FlowScale Nodes">
    Choose nodes with the **"[FS]"** prefix, indicating they are FlowScale-specific nodes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Workflow">
    Connect these input nodes to your workflow where external inputs are needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

{/* Image Description for Team: Screenshot showing FlowScale I/O nodes being added to ComfyUI workspace with connection process and [FS] prefix visible */}

### Adding Output Nodes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for Output Nodes">
    In the node search, type one of the following output node names:
    - **SaveImage** - For image outputs
    - **SaveText** - For text outputs
    - **SaveVideo** - For video outputs
    - **SaveAudio** - For audio outputs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select FlowScale Nodes">
    Again, choose nodes with the **"[FS]"** prefix
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Workflow">
    Connect these output nodes to capture the final results of your workflow
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect All Nodes">
    Ensure all I/O nodes are properly connected to your workflow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Workflow">
    Click the **Save** button in the ComfyUI workspace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Status">
    Look for a **green checkmark** next to your workflow in the left sidebar, indicating successful configuration
  </Step>
