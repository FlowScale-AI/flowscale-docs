import DeploymentTroubleshooting from '/snippets/troubleshooting/deployment.mdx';

Deploy your ComfyUI workflows as production APIs with automatic documentation, interactive interfaces, and enterprise scaling.

<Warning>
**Haven't set up your workflow yet?** You'll need to complete the [Import/Create Workflows guide](/getting-started/import-create-workflows) first. The deployment process requires a fully configured, tested workflow as its foundation.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Ensure your workflow is ready for deployment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Successful Execution">
    Run your workflow successfully in ComfyUI workspace to verify functionality
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Workflow">
    Save the workflow after successful execution to create a stable version
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Dependencies">
    Verify all models and custom nodes are properly configured
  </Step>
</Steps>

  />
</Frame>

{/* Image Description for Team: Screenshot of ComfyUI workspace after successful execution showing nodes with green checkmarks and completion status */}

<Warning>
**Important**: The workflow must run successfully at least once in the ComfyUI workspace before deployment. This ensures all models and custom nodes are properly configured and the platform can verify the workflow's functionality.
</Warning>

## Configure API Interface

Transform your workflow into a standardized API by defining inputs and outputs:

- Create intuitive parameters for users
- Generate automatic documentation
- Build interactive interfaces
- Establish reliable API contracts

<Note>
By default, workflows are not configured for deployment. You'll notice a **red cross mark** next to unconfigured workflows in your project's workflow sidebar.
</Note>

    alt="Project sidebar displaying workflow list with red cross marks indicating unconfigured deployment status"
  />
</Frame>

{/* Image Description for Team: Screenshot of FlowScale project sidebar showing workflow list with red cross icons indicating unconfigured deployment status */}

Configure which inputs are user-controllable and how outputs should be formatted for different consumer types.

### Configuration Methods

There are two primary ways to configure a workflow for deployment:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="FlowScale I/O Nodes (Recommended)">
    Use specialized FlowScale I/O nodes that are designed for deployment configuration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced I/O Configurator">
    Use the advanced configuration interface for complex setups. [Read more about advanced API configuration](/deploy-api/overview).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## FlowScale I/O Nodes

Use FlowScale I/O nodes to define API inputs and outputs. Choose which controls users need without exposing unnecessary complexity.

### Adding Input Nodes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Node Search">
    Double-click on an empty area in the ComfyUI workspace to open the node search
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for Input Nodes">
    Type one of the following input node names:
    - **InputText** - For text prompts and string inputs
    - **InputImage** - For image uploads
    - **InputNumber** - For numeric parameters
    - **InputSlider** - For slider controls
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select FlowScale Nodes">
    Choose nodes with the **"[FS]"** prefix, indicating they are FlowScale-specific nodes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Workflow">
    Connect these input nodes to your workflow where external inputs are needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

{/* Image Description for Team: Screenshot showing FlowScale I/O nodes being added to ComfyUI workspace with connection process and [FS] prefix visible */}

### Adding Output Nodes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for Output Nodes">
    In the node search, type one of the following output node names:
    - **SaveImage** - For image outputs
    - **SaveText** - For text outputs
    - **SaveVideo** - For video outputs
    - **SaveAudio** - For audio outputs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select FlowScale Nodes">
    Again, choose nodes with the **"[FS]"** prefix
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Workflow">
    Connect these output nodes to capture the final results of your workflow
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Available FlowScale I/O Nodes

| Node Type | Purpose | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **[FS] InputText** | Text input field | Prompts, descriptions, parameters |
| **[FS] InputImage** | Image upload | Reference images, masks, source images |
| **[FS] InputNumber** | Numeric input | Steps, strength, dimensions |
| **[FS] InputSlider** | Range slider | CFG scale, denoise strength |

| **[FS] SaveText** | Text output | Generated text, metadata |
| **[FS] SaveVideo** | Video output | Animated sequences |
| **[FS] SaveAudio** | Audio output | Generated audio files |

### Verify Configuration

After adding FlowScale I/O nodes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect All Nodes">
    Ensure all I/O nodes are properly connected to your workflow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Workflow">
    Click the **Save** button in the ComfyUI workspace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Status">
    Look for a **green checkmark** next to your workflow in the left sidebar, indicating successful configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

### API Integration

Your workflow is now accessible via REST API from any application or system:

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl -X POST https://api.flowscale.ai/v1/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workflow_id": "wf_abc123",
    "inputs": {
      "prompt": "A beautiful sunset over mountains",
      "steps": 20,
      "cfg": 7.5
    }
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.flowscale.ai/v1/run', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    workflow_id: 'wf_abc123',
    inputs: {
      prompt: 'A beautiful sunset over mountains',
      steps: 20,
      cfg: 7.5
    }
  })
});
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.flowscale.ai/v1/run',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer your-api-key',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={
        'workflow_id': 'wf_abc123',
        'inputs': {
            'prompt': 'A beautiful sunset over mountains',
            'steps': 20,
            'cfg': 7.5
        }

{/* Image Description for Team: Screenshot of advanced deployment settings showing GPU selection, scaling configuration, timeout settings, and cost estimation */}

### Input/Output Settings

Configure how your workflow interacts with the API:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Input Parameters">
    - **Text prompts**: String inputs with validation
    - **Numeric values**: Sliders, number inputs with ranges
    - **Image uploads**: File handling with format restrictions
    - **Dropdown options**: Predefined choices for models/styles
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Output Formats">
    - **Images**: PNG, JPEG, WebP with quality settings
    - **JSON data**: Structured response with metadata
    - **File downloads**: Direct file URLs for generated content
    - **Batch results**: Multiple outputs from single request
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
