import DeploymentTroubleshooting from '/snippets/troubleshooting/deployment.mdx';

Once your workflows are set up in the ComfyUI Editor, you can easily move to the deployment stage. By the time you reach this document, we assume your workflows are properly imported/created and all custom nodes or models are set up.

<Info>
If you haven't set up your workflows yet, please refer to the [Import/Create Workflows guide](/getting-started/import-create-workflows) first.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure your workflow meets these requirements:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Successful Execution">
    Run your workflow at least once successfully in the ComfyUI editor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Workflow">
    Save the workflow after successful execution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Dependencies">
    Confirm all models and custom nodes are properly set up
  </Step>
</Steps>

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: ComfyUI editor showing a successful workflow execution with green status indicators]**

<Warning>
**Important**: The workflow must run successfully at least once in the ComfyUI editor before deployment. This ensures all models and custom nodes are properly configured and the platform can verify the workflow's functionality.
</Warning>

## Configure Workflow for Deployment

All workflows consist of interconnected nodes, with some serving as input nodes and others as output nodes. The platform needs to identify these input and output nodes to:

- Create API parameters for the deployed workflow
- Generate the playground user interface
- Define the workflow's external interface

<Info>
By default, workflows are not configured for deployment. You'll notice a **red cross mark** next to unconfigured workflows in your project's workflow sidebar.
</Info>

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Project sidebar showing workflow list with red cross marks next to unconfigured workflows]**

### Understanding I/O Configuration

When you deploy a workflow, FlowScale AI needs to understand:
- **Which nodes accept external inputs** (text prompts, images, parameters)
- **Which nodes produce outputs** (generated images, text, data)
- **How these inputs/outputs should be exposed** in the API and playground

### Configuration Methods

There are two primary ways to configure a workflow for deployment:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="FlowScale I/O Nodes (Recommended)">
    Use specialized FlowScale I/O nodes that are designed for deployment configuration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced I/O Configurator">
    Use the advanced configuration interface for complex setups. [Read more about advanced API configuration](/deploy-api/overview).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using FlowScale I/O Nodes

The easiest way to configure your workflow is using FlowScale's specialized input and output nodes.

### Adding Input Nodes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Node Search">
    Double-click on an empty area in the ComfyUI editor to open the node search
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for Input Nodes">
    Type one of the following input node names:
    - **InputText** - For text prompts and string inputs
    - **InputImage** - For image uploads
    - **InputNumber** - For numeric parameters
    - **InputSlider** - For slider controls
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select FlowScale Nodes">
    Choose nodes with the **"[FS]"** prefix, indicating they are FlowScale-specific nodes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Workflow">
    Connect these input nodes to your workflow where external inputs are needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: ComfyUI editor showing node search dialog with FlowScale I/O input nodes with "[FS]" prefix visible in search results]**

<Frame>

    alt="Adding FlowScale I/O nodes to workflow"
  />
</Frame>

### Adding Output Nodes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for Output Nodes">
    In the node search, type one of the following output node names:
    - **SaveImage** - For image outputs
    - **SaveText** - For text outputs
    - **SaveVideo** - For video outputs
    - **SaveAudio** - For audio outputs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select FlowScale Nodes">
    Again, choose nodes with the **"[FS]"** prefix
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Workflow">
    Connect these output nodes to capture the final results of your workflow
  </Step>
</Steps>

**[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: ComfyUI editor showing FlowScale output nodes (SaveImage, SaveText, etc.) being connected to a workflow]**

### Available FlowScale I/O Nodes

| Node Type | Purpose | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **[FS] InputText** | Text input field | Prompts, descriptions, parameters |
| **[FS] InputImage** | Image upload | Reference images, masks, source images |
| **[FS] InputNumber** | Numeric input | Steps, strength, dimensions |
| **[FS] InputSlider** | Range slider | CFG scale, denoise strength |
| **[FS] SaveImage** | Image output | Generated images, processed images |
| **[FS] SaveText** | Text output | Generated text, metadata |
| **[FS] SaveVideo** | Video output | Animated sequences |
| **[FS] SaveAudio** | Audio output | Generated audio files |

### Verify Configuration

After adding FlowScale I/O nodes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect All Nodes">
    Ensure all I/O nodes are properly connected to your workflow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Workflow">
    Click the **Save** button in the ComfyUI editor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Status">
    Look for a **green checkmark** next to your workflow in the left sidebar, indicating successful configuration
  </Step>
