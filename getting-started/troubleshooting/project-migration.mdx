## Overview

FlowScale AI has transitioned from GitHub authentication to Google authentication to provide a better user experience. If you previously used our platform with GitHub login, we've created a seamless migration process to ensure you don't lose access to your existing projects.

## How Migration Works

When you log in with Google using the **same email address** that was associated with your GitHub account, FlowScale will automatically detect your previous projects and initiate a migration process.

### What Gets Migrated

During the migration process, the following will be imported from your GitHub repositories to our database:

- **All your projects** and their configurations
- **Workflow files** and versions
- **Project settings** and metadata
- **Model uploads** and custom nodes (if applicable)
- **Deployment configurations**

### Migration Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in with Google">
    Use the same email address that was associated with your GitHub account when logging into FlowScale.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Detection">
    Our system will automatically detect that you have existing projects from your GitHub integration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Migration Initiation">
    You'll see a migration prompt explaining that your projects are being imported. This process happens behind the scenes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Project Import">
    Your GitHub repositories containing FlowScale projects will be scanned and imported into our database.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verification">
    Once complete, you'll be able to access all your projects from the dashboard as before.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What to Expect

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Migration Timeline">
    - **Small projects** (1-5 workflows): Usually complete within 2-3 minutes
    - **Medium projects** (5-20 workflows): May take 5-10 minutes
    - **Large projects** (20+ workflows): Could take up to 15-20 minutes
    
    You'll receive a notification once the migration is complete.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="During Migration">
    - You can continue using FlowScale while migration happens in the background
    - Migrated projects will appear in your dashboard as they're processed
    - You may see a progress indicator for large migrations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="After Migration">
    - All projects will be accessible from your FlowScale dashboard
    - No changes to your workflow files or configurations
    - Existing deployments will continue to work normally
    - GitHub repositories remain unchanged (they're just copied, not moved)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Migration Issues

<Warning>
If you encounter issues during migration, these solutions usually resolve common problems.
</Warning>

### Migration Not Starting

If the migration process doesn't start automatically:

1. **Verify email match**: Ensure you're using the exact same email address from your GitHub account
2. **Clear browser cache**: Sometimes cached data can interfere with the detection process
3. **Try incognito mode**: Test logging in using an incognito/private browser window
4. **Wait a few minutes**: The detection system may need a moment to process your login

### Projects Missing After Migration

If some projects don't appear after migration:

1. **Check repository permissions**: Ensure FlowScale had access to all your repositories
2. **Private repositories**: Make sure private repos containing FlowScale projects were accessible
3. **Repository naming**: Projects may have been in repositories with non-standard names
4. **Contact support**: We can manually review your account for missing projects

### Migration Stuck or Failed

If migration appears stuck or fails:

1. **Refresh the page**: Sometimes the status display needs updating
2. **Check internet connection**: Ensure you have a stable connection
3. **Large projects**: Very large projects may take longer than expected
4. **Try logging out and back in**: This can restart the migration process

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will my GitHub repositories be deleted?">
    No, your GitHub repositories remain completely untouched. We only copy the project data to our database - nothing is moved or deleted from GitHub.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I still use GitHub integration after migration?">
    After migration, FlowScale operates independently of GitHub. Your projects will be managed within our platform, and you won't need GitHub access for FlowScale functionality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I used multiple GitHub accounts?">
    If you had projects across multiple GitHub accounts, you'll need to contact support to help consolidate them under your new Google account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I migrate later if I skip it now?">
    Yes, the migration option will remain available. However, we recommend migrating as soon as possible to ensure continued access to your projects.
