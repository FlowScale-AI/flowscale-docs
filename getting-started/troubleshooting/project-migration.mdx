## Why We're Making This Change

FlowScale AI has transitioned from GitHub authentication to Google authentication to provide significant improvements:

- **Lower friction** ‚Äì no GitHub permission pop‚Äëups or PATs.
- **Greater privacy** ‚Äì FlowScale AI no longer requests repo‚Äëlevel scopes.
- **Simpler storage** ‚Äì projects now live securely in FlowScale AI's own database (no Git repos to maintain).

## Before You Begin

| ‚úîÔ∏è Do | ‚ùå Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Sign in with **the same email address** you previously used on GitHub. | Use a different Google address if you want your old projects back. |
| Make sure you can still access that GitHub account. | Disconnect GitHub until migration finishes. |

## Step-by-Step Migration

### Sign In with Google

1. Browse to **app.flowscale.ai**.
2. Click **Continue with Google**.
3. Select the **same email** that matches your GitHub account.

### Connect GitHub One Last Time

1. You are prompted to **Connect GitHub**. Click **Authorize**.
2. Approve the read‚Äëonly permission request.

<Warning>
**Heads‚Äëup:** If the GitHub account's primary email does not match your Google email, the wizard will block migration. Switch accounts or update your GitHub email before retrying.
</Warning>

### Start Migration

1. After a successful GitHub link, the **Start Migration** button appears.
2. Click it to begin.

### Track Progress

- A progress bar shows each project as it's imported. Larger repos take longer.

### Finish & Open Dashboard

1. When everything is green, click **Go to Dashboard**.
2. Confirm that every project, workflow, and environment variable is present.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q ‚Äî I accidentally used a different Google account. Can I merge later?**

Currently, no. Log out and sign back in with the original email to trigger migration.

**Q ‚Äî My projects didn't appear. What should I do?**

Go to Profile page and verify that the email you are logged in with is the same as the github account email that you were working with before? If issues persist, email [hello@flowscale.ai](mailto:hello@flowscale.ai) with your GitHub username.

**Q ‚Äî Will FlowScale AI still push changes back to GitHub?**

New projects stay entirely inside FlowScale AI.

## Troubleshooting Migration Issues

<Warning>
If you encounter issues during migration, these solutions usually resolve common problems.
</Warning>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Migration Not Starting">
    If the migration process doesn't start automatically:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Verify Email Match">
        Ensure you're using the exact same email address from your GitHub account
      </Step>
      <Step title="Clear Browser Cache">
        Sometimes cached data can interfere with the detection process
      </Step>
      <Step title="Try Incognito Mode">
        Test logging in using an incognito/private browser window
      </Step>
      <Step title="Wait and Retry">
        The detection system may need a moment to process your login
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Missing Projects">
    If some projects don't appear after migration:

    <Checklist>
      <Check>**Repository permissions**: Ensure FlowScale AI had access to all your repositories</Check>
      <Check>**Private repositories**: Make sure private repos containing FlowScale projects were accessible</Check>
      <Check>**Repository naming**: Projects may have been in repositories with non-standard names</Check>
      <Check>**Contact support**: We can manually review your account for missing projects</Check>
    </Checklist>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Migration Stuck/Failed">
    If migration appears stuck or fails:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Quick Fixes">
        1. **Refresh the page**: Sometimes the status display needs updating
        2. **Check internet connection**: Ensure you have a stable connection
        3. **Try logging out and back in**: This can restart the migration process
      </Accordion>
      
      <Accordion title="For Large Projects">
        - Very large projects may take longer than the estimated time
        - Check your network stability during long migrations
