## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I create my first workflow?">
    1. **Sign up** at [app.flowscale.ai](https://app.flowscale.ai)
    2. **Create a project** from your dashboard
    3. **Import a workflow** by uploading a ComfyUI JSON file, or
    4. **Start with a template** from our pre-built collection
    5. **Test the workflow** in the cloud editor
    6. **Deploy** when you're ready to create an API

    See our [Import & Create Workflows](/getting-started/import-create-workflows) guide for detailed steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What file formats can I import?">
    FlowScale supports several import formats:
    - **Workflow JSON**: Standard ComfyUI export format
    - **PNG with metadata**: Images with embedded workflow data
    - **Workflow templates**: FlowScale-specific templates

    The platform automatically detects the format and converts it appropriately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I see my uploaded models?">
    If your models aren't appearing:
    
    **Check file format**:
    - Supported: `.safetensors`, `.ckpt`, `.pth`, `.bin`
    - Ensure files aren't corrupted during upload
    
    **Verify upload completion**:
    - Large models may take time to process
    - Check the upload progress indicator
    
    **Model placement**:
    - Models appear in the appropriate category (Checkpoints, LoRAs, VAEs)
    - Use the search function if you have many models
    
    **Refresh the interface**:
    - Sometimes a browser refresh resolves display issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I invite team members to my project?">
    1. **Go to project settings** (gear icon in your project)
    2. **Click "Team Members"** tab
    3. **Click "Invite Member"**
    4. **Enter email address** and select role level
    5. **Send invitation** - they'll receive an email to join

    **Role levels**:
    - **Admin**: Full project management access
    - **Owner**: Complete control including billing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Workflow Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My workflow fails with 'Model not found' error">
    **Common causes and solutions**:

    **Missing models**:
    - Check if all required models are uploaded to your project
    - Verify model names match exactly (case-sensitive)
    - Ensure models are in the correct folders (checkpoints/, loras/, etc.)

    **Model path issues**:
    - Use relative paths in your workflow, not absolute paths
    - FlowScale automatically maps model paths to the correct locations

    **Model compatibility**:
    - Ensure model format is supported (.safetensors, .ckpt, .pth)
    - Check if the model is compatible with your ComfyUI nodes

    **Quick fix**: Go to the node causing the error and re-select the model from the dropdown.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workflow runs locally but fails in FlowScale">
    **Environment differences**:

    **Custom nodes**: 
    - Install required custom nodes in FlowScale
    - Some nodes may not be compatible with cloud execution

    **Model versions**:
    - Ensure you're using the same model versions
    - Check if models were uploaded correctly

    **File paths**:
    - Remove any hardcoded local file paths
    - Use FlowScale's file upload nodes instead

    **Dependencies**:
    - Some workflows may require specific Python packages
    - Contact support if you need additional dependencies installed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workflow execution is very slow">
    **Performance optimization**:

    **GPU selection**:
    - Use higher-tier GPUs (L4, L40S, A100, H100, H200) for complex workflows
    - T4 and A10G GPUs are suitable for simple to moderate workflows
    - B200 for cutting-edge models requiring maximum performance

    **Model optimization**:
    - Use FP16 precision when possible
    - Consider smaller model variants for faster processing

    **Workflow structure**:
    - Minimize unnecessary nodes and connections
    - Use batch processing for multiple similar operations
    - Cache results when appropriate

    **Cold start delays**:
    - First execution may be slower due to model loading
    - Subsequent runs are typically much faster
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Out of memory errors">
    **Memory management**:

    **Reduce batch size**:
    - Lower the batch_size parameter in your nodes
    - Process images individually rather than in batches

    **Image resolution**:
    - Use smaller image dimensions for development
    - Upscale as a separate step if needed

    **Model selection**:
    - Use smaller models or quantized versions
    - Unload models when not needed

    **GPU upgrade**:
    - Switch to a GPU with more VRAM (L4, L40S, A100, H100, H200)
    - Consider the memory requirements of your specific workflow
    - H200 provides maximum VRAM (141GB) for the largest models
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API deployment fails or times out">
    **Deployment troubleshooting**:

    **Workflow validation**:
    - Ensure workflow runs successfully in the editor first
    - Check for any error nodes or warnings

    **Input/output configuration**:
    - Verify all required inputs are properly configured
    - Ensure output nodes are correctly set up

    **Resource requirements**:
    - Check if your workflow requires specific GPU types
    - Verify sufficient resources are available

    **Network issues**:
    - Temporary network problems can cause deployment failures
    - Try deploying again after a few minutes

    If issues persist, check the deployment logs or contact support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API returns errors or unexpected results">
    **API debugging**:

    **Input validation**:
    - Check API request format matches documentation
    - Verify required parameters are included
    - Ensure data types match expectations (string, number, etc.)

    **Authentication**:
    - Confirm API key is correct and has proper permissions
    - Check if API key has expired or been revoked

    **Response format**:
    - Review API documentation for expected response structure
    - Check if the workflow output nodes are configured correctly

    **Rate limiting**:
    - Ensure you're not exceeding API rate limits
    - Implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Playground UI not loading or functioning properly">
    **UI troubleshooting**:

    **Browser compatibility**:
    - Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
    - Clear browser cache and cookies
    - Disable browser extensions that might interfere

    **Network connectivity**:
    - Check your internet connection
    - Try accessing from a different network

    **Input handling**:
    - Ensure uploaded files meet size and format requirements
    - Check if all required fields are filled

    **Performance**:
    - Large files may take time to upload and process
    - Be patient with complex workflows
