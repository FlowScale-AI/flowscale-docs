# FlowScale AI Documentation Image Placeholder Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the systematic replacement of all existing images and image placeholders in the FlowScale AI documentation with detailed, descriptive placeholders using Mintlify's image components. The goal is to provide clear specifications for future image creation while maintaining the documentation's narrative flow and technical accuracy.

## Scope and Methodology

### Total Image Inventory
- **12 documentation files** containing image references
- **~95 total image references** across all files
- **75 existing Frame/img components** to be replaced
- **45 placeholder comments** to be converted to proper placeholders
- **15 inline image references** to be formalized

### Implementation Approach
1. Replace existing `<Frame><img>` components with descriptive `<Frame>` placeholders
2. Convert image placeholder comments to structured placeholders
3. Add placeholders for missing images referenced in text
4. Maintain narrative context and technical accuracy
5. Use consistent placeholder format throughout
